  <h2 id='preface' class='c005'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>It is admitted by students of history of every shade
of belief that the origin of Christianity and its rapid
spread over the ancient world is the most remarkable
fact in the recorded annals of the human race. When
we remember that it was, from the first, more or less
closely identified with the despised religion of the
despised Jews; that largely for this reason it had to
make its way against a united front, presented by the
learned and intelligent in the whole gentile world,
while the Jews themselves almost unanimously repudiated
it; that the most efficiently organized
government that had existed until then, was indifferent
or hostile; that it set before the heathen
world a condition of society in which all current
economic ideas were transformed, and that it demanded
a complete renunciation of its time-honored
creeds, we may well ask in amazement, “How came
these things to pass?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Second in order among the great facts of ancient
history is the growth of the Roman Empire. Here
we see a people at first occupying a few square miles
of territory, compelled for nearly fifteen generations
to exert themselves to the utmost to keep their enemies
at bay, suddenly bursting the barriers that confined
them and in less than half this time bringing under
their scepter almost the whole of the then known
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>world. Rome’s conquests have been exceeded in
rapidity, but they have never been equalled in permanence.</p>

<p class='c007'>The triumphs of Christianity and those of Roman
arms stand in a certain relation to each other, notwithstanding
the fact that the latter were gained with
material, the former with spiritual, weapons. When
the conquests of the one were ended, the other began.
When material forces had spent themselves, men
began to turn, reluctantly indeed, to spiritual agencies
and undertook to subdue the powers of darkness that
had so long held sway in the human breast. While the
arms of Rome were engaged in overcoming the martial
opposition of her enemies, Greece was occupied
with the effort to subjugate the passions of men by the
weapons of the intellect. By the time Roman conquests
had reached their limits it had been demonstrated
that Greece, too, could go no farther. But
Greece did not fail because there were no more
worlds to conquer: it was because men had learned
that her weapons were powerless to compass the end
in view. “He that ruleth his own spirit is mightier
than he that taketh a city,” was the lesson that the
best of the Greek philosophers strove to impress
upon men, but strove in vain.</p>

<p class='c007'>It will always remain a matter of interest to study
the intellectual sphere in which the old doctrines and
the new faith conflict. What was the best that
Greek thought had to offer to the world, and for what
reasons did the world reject it?</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>In the following pages I have attempted to put before
my readers a solution of some of the problems
to which this question gives rise. No one will deny
that Seneca stood on the threshold of Christianity,
while in the opinion of many he had already passed
within; yet all will admit that, at best, he fell far
short of the standard Christianity sets up for its converts.
Plutarch is not claimed by Christians, but he
exemplifies many of their virtues, and commends
many of the precepts they endeavored to put in practice.
These two men best represent the strong and
the weak points of characters formed under the
stimulus of earnest effort to lead upright lives and to
discharge faithfully their duties to themselves, their
fellow men, and the higher power that controlled their
destinies. I have selected a typical work from the
writings of both as a nucleus around which to group
such reflections and facts as seem best fitted to illustrate
the environment in which they lived and the intellectual
inheritance to which they had fallen heir,
while I have allowed each to speak for himself on
one of the profoundest problems that has ever engaged
the serious attention of man.</p>

<p class='c007'>Surely, it cannot be a merely accidental coincidence
that a Greek at Delphi, a Roman in his adopted city,
a Jew in Alexandria, and another Jew in Palestine,
who had been converted to Christianity and had
adopted the profession of a traveling evangelist,
should at the same time, yet almost or quite independently
of each other, maintain the doctrine of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>divine Providence or preach a gospel that recognized
it as a fundamental dogma. The treatise of Philo,
though no longer extant in the original Greek, is
more extensive than the tracts here brought together.
The three united in a single volume would make a
remarkable trinity in the history of human thought.
The feeling was evidently widespread, both consciously
and unconsciously, that God had never before
been so near to men, though but a few had
learned that the Word had become flesh and dwelt
among them, full of grace and truth.</p>

</div>
<p class='c006'>The following are the principal works used or consulted
in preparing the matter relating to Seneca:</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Oeuvres complètes de Senèque. Par Charpentier et Lemaistre. 4
tomes. Paris, 1885.</i></p>

<p class='c003'><i>Oeuvres complètes de Senèque. Publiées sous la direction de M.

<p class='c003'><i>Lucius Annaeus Seneca und das Christenthum. Von Michael

<p class='c003'><i>La Religion romaine. Par Gaston Boissier, 2 tomes. Paris. 1892.</i></p>

<p class='c003'><i>History of the Romans under the Empire. By Charles Merivale.
7 vols. New York, 1863-5.</i></p>

<p class='c003'><i>L. Annaei Senecae opera quae supersunt. Ed. Frid. Haase. Voll. I,
II, III. Lipsiae, 1871-62-53.</i></p>

<p class='c009'>The two Paris editions have the Latin text and the
French translation on the same page. Both translations
are characteristically French, and consequently
very smooth and agreeable to read. But they preserve
few of the salient features of the original, and
render the thoughts rather than the style of Seneca.
To the translation is accorded the place of honor
both in type and position. The German version
holds very close to the text and errs, perhaps, somewhat
at the other extreme as compared with the
French. The work of Baumgarten is thorough and
painstaking. It is not endorsing all the author’s
views to say that it is the best recent book on Seneca
and his times.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>
  <h2 id='chap1' class='c005'>SENECA: HIS CHARACTER AND ENVIRONMENT.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>Lucius Annaeus Seneca, surnamed the Philosopher
to distinguish him from his father the Rhetorician,
was born in Corduba,<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c010'><sup>[1]</sup></a> in Spain, about 4 <span class='fss'>B. C.</span>—authorities
differ by several years as to the precise
date. When quite young he was brought to Rome
by his father. He devoted himself with great zeal
and brilliant success to rhetorical and philosophical
studies. In the reign of Claudius he attained
the office of quaestor and subsequently rose to
the rank of senator. In the year 41 he was banished
to the island of Corsica on a charge that is admitted
to have been false, but the nature of which is
not clearly understood.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this barren and inhospitable island he was compelled
to remain eight years. He was then recalled
to Rome and entrusted with the education of the
young Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, who afterwards
became emperor of Rome, and notorious as the
monster Nero. For five years after his accession to
the principate, the young emperor treated his former
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>teacher with much deference, consulted him on all
important matters, and seems to have been largely
guided by his advice. He also testified his regard
for him by raising him to the rank of consul. In
course of time, however, the feelings and conduct of
the prince underwent a change. The possession of
unlimited power by a character that was both weak
and vain; the adulation of the conscienceless favorites
with whom he surrounded himself; the intrigues or
cabals to whom the high morality of the philosopher
was a standing rebuke; and the naturally vicious
temper of Nero, all conspired to prepare the way for
the downfall of Seneca. When the conspiracy of
Calpurnius Piso against the monarch was discovered,
the charge of participation, or at least of criminal
knowledge, was brought against Seneca, and he was
condemned to die. Allowed to choose the means of
ending his life, he caused a vein to be opened
and thus slowly bled to death. It was his destiny
to be compelled to take his departure from this
world in the way he had so often commended to
others; indeed it is probable that his reiterated
encomiums upon suicide as an effectual remedy
against the ills of this life, was not without its influence
upon his executioners. They probably wanted
to give him the opportunity to prove by his works
the sincerity of his faith.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the closing scene he told his disconsolate
friends that the only bequest he was permitted to
leave to them was the example of an honorable life;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>and this he besought them to keep in faithful remembrance.
He implored his weeping wife to restrain
the expression of her grief, and bade her seek in the
recollection of the life and virtues of her husband a
solace for her loss.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was the fortune of Seneca not only to be well
born, but also to be well brought up and carefully
educated. That he appreciated the high worth of his
mother is evident from the words, “best of mothers,”
with which he addressed her in the Consolation to
Helvia. His father, though wealthy, was a man of
rigid morality, of temperate habits, of great industry,
and possessed very unusual literary attainments.
His older brother, better known as Junius Gallio
from the name of the family into which he was
adopted, was for some time proconsul of Achaia,
in which capacity he is mentioned in the Acts, xviii,
12-17. Seneca’s younger brother was the father of
Lucan, the well-known author of the poem, Pharsalia.
Both his mother and his aunt,—he was an
especial favorite of the latter—were not only women
of exalted character, but they had acquired an intellectual
culture that was very uncommon for their
sex in their day.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our authorities for a life of Seneca and for an estimate
of his character are fairly ample and have
been variously interpreted. Nothing can be gained
by taking up the controversy anew. To some of his
contemporaries even, he was more or less of an
enigma. Others, again, regarded him as a time-server,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>a hypocrite, a man whose professions were belied by
his actions. Still others,—and they are largely in the
majority—are more lenient in their judgment; though
they cannot exculpate him from inconsistencies, they
excuse them by pointing to the extremely difficult position
in which he was placed during the greater part of
his life. He has strong partisans who are attracted
and charmed by the sublime sentiments scattered
so profusely through his writings; his enemies, in
forming their opinions, lay the chief stress on what
they regard as the inexcusable deeds of his life. It
is too late to add anything to the evidence either pro
or contra. All that it is proposed to do in this essay is
to place before the reader a picture of the man,
mainly from his own writings, as the chief exponent
of the highest philosophy reached by the ancient
world before this philosophy was supplanted by the
new religion that was destined to take its place
in the thought of mankind. Seneca was next
to Cicero, or rather along with Cicero, the most
distinguished Roman philosopher; but as a philosopher
he has received the far greater share
of attention. Both were Romans at heart; both
were earnestly engaged in the search for the
supreme good; both were guilty of conduct inconsistent
with their professions; both tried and tried
in vain to combine a life devoted to reflection with
with an active career in the service of the state; and
both failed. But Seneca not only had a higher ideal
than Cicero; he also came nearer attaining it.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>He was less vain, less hungry for public honors
and applause, and attached less importance to mere
outward display. As a thinker Seneca has more
originality than Cicero, is less dependent upon books,
knows better the motives that underlie human conduct.
Both were essentially Roman in their views
of life, and it is only by keeping this in mind that we
are able to explain, if not to excuse, the lack of harmony
between what they said and what they did;
between what they preached and what they practised.</p>

<p class='c007'>Like that of Cicero, Seneca’s was no adamantine
soul, no unyielding barrier against which the vices
of his time beat in vain. He had the Roman liking
for what is practical. He tried to be a statesman
and was somewhat of a courtier when to be a courtier
and an upright man was impossible. He was no
Socrates to whom virtue, the fundamentally and intrinsically
right, was more important than anything
else, than all else, even abstention from the political
turmoil of his time.</p>

<p class='c007'>When a long and acrimonious strife is carried on
over a man it is evidence that he is no ordinary person.
This has been the fate of Seneca in an eminent
degree. During the Middle Ages, and even
after their close, a great deal of attention was paid to
his reputed correspondence with St. Paul. The
National Library in Paris contains more than sixty
MSS. of this pseudo-correspondence. That he was
claimed as a Christian need surprise no one. The poet
Virgil shared a similar fate; yet there is far less in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>writings of Virgil to mark him a Christian, or rather
as a writer who was in a sense divinely inspired,
than there is in Seneca to stamp him as a man who
had accepted the new faith. The rise and persistence
of such a literature is not an anomaly in the
history of thought. It is not out of harmony with
the spirit of an age when the church was supreme in
everything; when all questions were viewed from the
theological standpoint, and when every means were
employed to gain support for the existing ecclesiastical
organization. It was honestly believed that the
practice or profession of a high morality, except
under the sanction and guidance of the church, was
impossible. It was taken as a matter of course, that
a good man, one who eloquently preached righteousness,
who seemed to be conscious of a struggle within
himself between the flesh<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c010'><sup>[2]</sup></a> and the spirit, must
have been enlightened from on high. Given the internal
evidence of Seneca’s own writings, it was not
difficult to supply the complementary external testimony.</p>

<p class='c007'>This all-embracing and all-absorbing power of the
church lasted about a thousand years and ended with
the Reformation, though it had begun to decline
some two centuries earlier. For this condition of
things the Roman empire had prepared the way. It
was the prototype to which, in part unconsciously
and in part consciously, ecclesiastical authority was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>made to conform. Notwithstanding the fact that the
Gospel was first widely proclaimed in Greek lands
and the body of its doctrine formulated in the Greek
tongue, when the church began to aspire to universal
dominion it naturally assumed the garb of Roman
secular authority. The Eastern Empire was regarded
as an offshoot from, rather than as a continuation of,
the empire that had so long ruled the world from the
great city on the banks of the Tiber. The natural
consequence was that the Latin language in time
supplanted the Greek, and ecclesiastical thought
flowed in the channels worn by the political thought
that had preceded it. The struggle in later times for
the supremacy of the state as against the church was
merely the effort to return to a condition of things
that had existed before the establishment of the
church. The Greeks were not less patriotic than
the Romans. The state occupied just as prominent
a place in their minds as it did in the minds of
the Romans. But it was their misfortune to appear
upon the scene of history, broken up into a large
number of small polities of nearly equal strength, and
the Greek mind never got beyond the particularism
thus inherited. It was their fundamental concept
of government. Rome represented a more advanced
type of political development than Greece, and if it had
been permitted to work out its own salvation without
external interference,—for the city at its worst was
hardly more corrupt than many a modern capital—it
might be in existence to-day. The Roman empire
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>endured so long because it was upheld by the patriotism
of its citizens. This was often narrowly selfish,
and frequently grossly unjust to foreigners, but it
was effectual in maintaining the supremacy of Rome
against all attempts from within or without to subvert
it. The Romans that were drawn toward philosophy
pursued it in a half-hearted manner because the
state occupied the first place in their minds. To
serve the state was the ultimate goal of their ambition.
The emperors, even the most corrupt, still represented
the government and as such received the
homage of good men. If we keep this fact in mind
we shall be able to understand the bravery and devotion
to duty of many of the officers and even soldiers
in the imperial forces. More or less out of reach of
the contaminating influences that were so powerful in
the capital, they performed the services expected of
them as became Romans.</p>

<p class='c007'>Long, long afterward, and when Rome was nominally
a Christian city, a German monk left its walls
as he was returning to his northern home, a far less
zealous churchman than he had entered it. Strange
coincidence! The city that had become the head of a
spiritual empire was no less corrupt and corrupting
than it had been as the head of a temporal empire.
More than sixteen centuries of experience, some of it
of the bitterest kind, had wrought no perceptible
change. The Christian followed in the footsteps of
the heathen.</p>

<p class='c007'>For us who have been brought up in the belief that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>morality and right and justice have a claim to our
services for their own sake, without accessory support
and under all circumstances, the devotion of the
Roman to his government, even the most unworthy,
is not easy to understand. Rome owed her greatness
more to the bravery of her citizens in war than to any
other cause. To this virtue they always accorded the
foremost place, and to those who displayed it, the
highest honors the state could bestow.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Seneca was a man of peace. This fact had
without doubt something to do in producing the unfavorable
estimate some of his contemporaries formed
of him. Tacitus, too, was not a military man; yet he
looks with a certain disdain upon those who devoted
themselves to the arts of peace rather than to the
profession of arms. He regards with less favor the
man who has wisely administered a province than
him who had extended the boundaries of the empire.</p>

<p class='c007'>We naturally incline to the opinion that no man
who respected himself could accept service under
such a ruler as Nero, or Caligula, or Domitian, unless
it were in the hope that he might mitigate a ferocious
temper or avert calamity from personal friends.
And yet, many tyrants since the dissolution of the
Roman empire have been served by honorable men;
and they have usually requited their services in the
same way, with exile, or confiscation of goods, or an
ignominious death.</p>

<p class='c007'>The readiness with which many of the best Romans
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>resorted to self-destruction as a release from misfortune
strikes us with surprise. Suicide is often mentioned
in the writings of Seneca, and always with approval.
It is not hard to understand this attitude of
mind if we recollect the relation the Roman regarded
as existing between himself and the state. The government
was in a sense a part of himself, and an
essential part. To the Greek there was still something
worth living for after the loss of country and
citizenship. He could devote himself to literature, or
philosophy, or to some more ignoble means of gaining
a livelihood. To the Roman such a thing was
well-nigh impossible, especially if he was a member
of one of the ruling families. Exile, exclusion from
service in the state, was to him the end of every thing.
Many Romans of whom one would have expected
better things are inconsolable so long as they are
compelled to live away from the capital with no certain
prospect of return. Need we wonder that to
many others life was no longer worth living, and that
they freely put an end to it with their own hand.
Often the best men sought surcease of sorrow in this
unnatural way. Those in whom the moral sense was
weak, plunged recklessly into debauchery and sensual
gratification. Literature, too, was corrupted to minister
to their corrupt tastes. We know little of the life
of the average Roman citizen; but there is sufficient
evidence within reach of the modern reader to prove
that the ruling class had few redeeming traits. The
downward tendency is plainly discernible in the last
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>days of the Republic. Julius and Augustus Cæsar
were men of depraved appetites and low morals. Their
talents as military captains and administrators, their
patronage of letters, and their tastes as literary men,
have somewhat put their moral delinquencies into the
background. There is no doubt that the example of
these and such men, accelerated the evil propensities
to which the Roman people were only too prone.
When the lowest depth of moral degradation was
reached, as in the declining years of Seneca, crime
and debauchery held high carnival in the imperial
household. There was no wickedness so flagrant, no
species of immorality so bestial, no deed so horrible,
that men shrank from it. For, had they not more
than once the example of the prince himself? It is
sometimes charitably said that Nero was insane.
There are men who think it too degrading to human
nature to hold it responsible for his crimes and indecencies.
Yet Nero’s excesses were the natural
results of unlimited power in irresponsible hands,
when the hands were servants of a heart that was
thoroughly corrupt, and a character that was weak,
and vain as it was weak. The same things have often
been repeated within the last eighteen hundred years;
but never was vice so rampant and so unblushing, on
such a large scale, as it was in Rome in the days of
Seneca.</p>

<p class='c007'>We must not believe, however, that there was no
decency, no regard for morality, no love of culture, to
be found in the Roman empire even in its worst
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>estate. There were always groups and coteries of
noble men and women who kept themselves free from
the prevailing corruption. There was always a saving
remnant that remained uncontaminated. Quintillian
was the center of such a group, and what he
was in Rome, Plutarch was in another part of the
empire, for they were almost exactly contemporaries.
The belief in God, in the immortality of the human
soul, and in man’s personal responsibility to a higher
power, kept some, perhaps many, who were not directly
under the degrading influence of the court, or
who had the moral strength to resist it, from deviating
very far from the path of rectitude. There were
slaves of whom better things could be said than of
their masters. But what were these among so many?</p>

<p class='c007'>Seneca and other writers of his time frequently
express contempt for those men who professed to be
philosophers, and whose lives brought only disgrace
upon the fair name of philosophy. He does not seem
to be aware that, in a measure at least, he is recording
an unfavorable verdict upon himself. Does he think
that his abstemiousness, his untiring industry, his devotion
to study ought to cover his shortcomings? It
looks so. He commends solitude, yet always remained
in the noonday of publicity. He inveighs
against riches, yet was the possessor of vast estates,
and was not above lending money at usurious rates of
interest. He teaches men to bear with fortitude the
inevitable ills of life, and ends by commending
suicide as a final resort. Compared with Socrates,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>to cite but a single name, Seneca was a very unworthy
exponent of practical philosophy. The former
took philosophy seriously, so seriously that he not
only wanted to live for it but was willing to die for it.
He kept aloof from politics because he felt that a
public career would interfere with a duty he owed to
a higher power. He, too, believed in a Providence,
but with him this belief amounted to a conviction.
All his reported words and deeds testify to this, while
Seneca acts and writes as if trying to convince himself
quite as much as others. Socrates had an abiding
faith in a personal God who not only watched over
his life, but cared for him in death. Duty was to him
a thing of such supreme importance that he never
hesitated to perform it, no matter what the consequences
to himself might be. Socrates taught nothing
he did not himself practice; Seneca, much. Socrates
feared neither God nor man; Seneca was afraid of
both. Socrates expected nothing of others that he did
not exact of himself; Seneca sets up a higher standard
of morals than he, under all circumstances, attained.
His precepts are better than his practice.
His fatal mistake lay in trying to do two things that
have always been found incompatible: to be a successful
politician and an upright man. There were
others besides Socrates, before the days of Seneca, in
whose life and character philosophy had had more
consistent exponents and faithful devotees than in
him. But when they found that philosophy and a
career in the service of the state were incompatible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>and reciprocally exclusive, they unhesitatingly gave
up the latter. Seneca can always admire high ideals,
but he cannot always imitate them. He is fascinated
when he gazes on the lofty heights to which virtue
had sometimes attained, and he often makes heroic
efforts to follow after; but he is only now and then
successful. It is no wonder, then, that Socrates had
even in his lifetime many ardent admirers and
enthusiastic disciples that remained true to his memory,
while Seneca had none.</p>

<p class='c007'>Canon Farrar is mistaken when he calls Seneca a
“seeker after God.” God was in no man’s thoughts
oftener than in his. Nor has any uninspired writer
given utterance to a larger number of noble sentiments
and lofty precepts than he. It is easy to extract
from his writings a complete code of morals, a
breviary of human conduct, that would differ but little
from that contained in the New Testament. He
is a conspicuous example of the heathen of whom
Paul says, they are without excuse. But while Seneca
is not a seeker after God he can with justice be called
a seeker after Christ. He is an earnest inquirer after
the peace that passeth understanding; after that serene
confidence that sustained the greatest and the
least of the Apostles, and the noble army of martyrs
no less. He lacks that Christian enthusiasm that
comes only through faith in a living Christ and in
His atonement.</p>

<p class='c007'>Seneca now and then caught a glimpse of that universal
kingdom which the company of believers expected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>would one day be established upon the earth.
He says, “No one can lead a happy life who thinks
only of himself and turns everything to his own use.
If you would live for yourself, you must live for
others. This bond of fellowship must be diligently
and sacredly guarded,—the bond that unites us all to
all and shows to us that there is a right common to
all nations which ought to be the more sacredly cherished
because it leads to that intimate friendship of
which we were speaking.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It is hard to see how he could write the following
striking passage without thinking of himself; for,
though guiltless of some of the vices he condemns,
there are others of which he cannot be acquitted.
After defining philosophy as nothing else than the
right way of living, or the science of living honorably,
or the art of passing a good life, and denouncing
the fraudulent professors of it, he proceeds:
“Many of the philosophers are of this description,
eloquent to their own condemnation; for if you hear
them arguing against avarice, against lust and ambition,
you would think they were making a public disclosure
of their own character, so entirely do the censures
which they utter in public flow back upon
themselves; so that it is right to regard them in no
other light than as physicians whose advertisements
contain medicine, but their medicine-chests, poison.
Some are not ashamed of their vices; but they invent
defenses for their own baseness, so that they may
even appear to sin with honor.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>To the same effect is the testimony of Nepos: “So
far am I from thinking that philosophy is the teacher
of life and the completer of happiness, that I consider
that none have greater need of teachers of living than
many who are engaged in the discussion of this subject.
For I see that a great part of those who give
most elaborate precepts in their school respecting
modesty and self-restraint, live at the same time in
the unrestrained desires of all lusts.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Both Seneca and Plutarch are firmly convinced that
man is the arbiter of his own happiness; but the former
found great difficulty in making a practical application
of the doctrine to his own case. Notwithstanding
the sorry spectacle presented to the world by
many professed philosophers, neither lost faith in
philosophy. It was the court of last resort. For the
man to whom philosophy will not bring happiness
there is no happiness in this world. To the importance
and benign influence of this culture of mind,
Seneca reverts again and again. He contends that
“He who frequents the school of a philosopher ought
every day to carry away with him something that
will be to his profit: he ought to return home a wiser
man. And he will so return, for such is the power of
philosophy that it not only benefits those who devote
themselves to it, but even those who talk about
it.” “You must change yourself, not your abode.
You may cross the sea, or as our Virgil says, ‘Lands
and cities may vanish from sight, yet wherever you
go your vices will follow you.’ When a certain person
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>made the same complaint to Socrates that you
make, he answered, ‘Why are you surprised that your
travels do you no good, when you take yourself with
you everywhere?’ If we could look into the mind
of a good man, what a beautiful vision, what purity,
we should behold beaming forth from its placid
depths! Here justice, there fortitude; here self-control,
there prudence. Besides these, sobriety, continence,
frankness and kindliness, and (who would believe
it?) humaneness, that rare trait in man, shed
their luster over him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Though Seneca’s life was full of contradictions and
inconsistencies when measured by the standard of
his own writings, it would be unjust to charge him
with hypocrisy. He was, within certain limits, a man
of moods; a man in whose mind conflicting desires
were continually striving for the mastery. It seems
to have been a hard matter for him to attain settled
convictions on a number of important questions.
Even the immortality of the soul, a subject upon
which he has much to say, and which to Plutarch is
an incontestable dogma, is to Seneca hardly more
than a hope. His mind matured early and there is
almost no evidence of development or change of views
or of style in his writings. He was such a man as nature
made him, and he was on the whole pretty well
satisfied with the product. Though he now and then
seems to be conscious of a certain lack of constancy,
and on the point of confessing his sins, he generally
ends by excusing them or by trying to show that they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>are venial. Yet the fact that he at times acknowledges
a kind of moral weakness is perhaps the chief reason
why Seneca has been so often claimed as a Christian,
while no such claim has ever been made for Plutarch
who sees no defects either in himself or his doctrine.</p>

<p class='c007'>The chief problem of philosophy has at all times
been, how to make the judgment supreme in all matters
that present themselves before the mind and how
to make the will carry out the decisions of the critical
faculty. When the poet says, “Video meliora proboque,
Deteriora sequor,” he is thinking of this irrepressible
conflict. Paul himself was not a stranger to
it, for he exclaims in a moment of self-abasement when
writing to Seneca’s fellow citizens, “The good which
I would, I do not; but the evil which I would not,
that I practice.” He, too, finds within himself a
“law,” a fact of human experience, that the flesh
wars against the spirit; that the appetencies are hard
to reconcile with the judgment. Seneca’s own writings
furnish abundant evidence that many who professed
to be philosophers used their intellects solely,
or chiefly, in devising means for gratifying their desires.
To men of his way of thinking the Epicureans
were a constant object of attack; yet the Epicureans
were generally consistent from their point of view
and in accordance with the postulates of their system.
The all-important question with every man who is in
the habit of giving an account to himself of his life
is how to get the most out of it,—how to formulate
a system of complete living. If the individual is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>goal, considered solely from the standpoint of his
earthly life, it is evident that he will act differently
in the same circumstances from him whose aim is the
good of society considered as an undying entity, or
the happiness of the individual regarded as an immortal
soul. The disagreements of philosophers have
always hinged on these fundamental problems and
it is strange that so little note has been made of
them. It is too often taken for granted that the
mere use of the reasoning faculties, that is, philosophy
<i>per se</i>, and without reference to the highest
good, is able to make men as nearly perfect as they
can become in this life, both as individuals and as
members of the community. It was the conviction
that philosophy had run its course; that it was
“played out,”—to use a phrase more expressive than
elegant—that made so many of the best men, in the
first Christian centuries, turn from it and seek refuge
in Christianity. They had become weary of the
ceaseless and acrimonious discussions of the different
philosophical schools. Disgusted with contradictions
and inconsistencies, they turned to the Gospel as
offering a solution of problems at which so many acute
thinkers had labored for centuries in vain.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has often been remarked that the Roman world
had grown old. Every experiment had been tried,
every theory had been suggested that might lead to
complete living; all had ended in failure and disappointment
for those who had the good of their fellow
men at heart. He who would perform a successful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>experiment in physics or chemistry must see to it
that all the necessary conditions have been provided.
If this is not done, no amount of care in manipulation
will bring about the desired result. The mere
presence of the proper ingredients, however pure,
will not insure success. So in society, the existence
and vitality of social forces will avail the reformer in
no wise unless he knows how to put a motive force
into men’s minds and hearts that will induce them to
aid him in bringing about the changes he proposes.
Some good men have been made so by a noble system
of philosophy, to the practical exemplification of
which they have devoted their lives. Both Greece
and Rome furnished not a few such. On the other
hand there have been many bad men who were made
so by following the tenets of a vicious philosophy.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are two reasons why Seneca has, for more
than eighteen hundred years, engaged the attention of
thinking men. No doubt the most important is his
extraordinary ability. The world will not willingly
forget the words of a great man, nor suffer his life to
pass into oblivion. It clings to thoughts and deeds
that are worthy to survive. Seneca not only had
something to say that men wanted to hear, but he
knew how to say it in such a way that they were glad
to listen. Great as has been the evil in the world at
all times it has never lacked many men who felt that
they were made for something better than the daily
concerns that occupied their time and labor. In
their better moments they found pleasure in listening
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>to the voices that spoke to them of something
more abiding than the fleeting affairs of this transitory
life.</p>

<p class='c007'>Seneca, too, was intensely human. He frequently
furnishes evidence of extraordinary mental strength
while now and then he sinks down in sheer exhaustion.
His mind ranges freely along the whole
scale of mental experiences; and though he dwell,
longest on the higher parts, he does not always do so.
The record of such an experience has an attraction for
many men. They see in it a counterpart of their
own struggles, and are rarely without hope that its
triumphs may be an earnest of their own.</p>

<p class='c007'>The scholar in politics is a character of whom we
hear a good deal, but as a matter of fact, scholarship,
in the true sense of the word, and successful politics,
as the world understands success, are a combination
that has rarely been made. Again, an ecclesiastical
statesman, strictly speaking, is an equally rare phenomenon
and has been since the days of the supremacy
of the Romish church. The greater the
success of the ecclesiastic in statecraft, the farther he
departed from the prescriptions of the church, or at
least of the Gospel. How often has the experience of
Wolsey been anticipated or repeated; and many men,
both laics and priests, have felt the truth of Shakespeare’s
thoughts, if they have not expressed them in
his words:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Had I but served my God with half the zeal</div>
      <div class='line'>I served my king, he would not in mine age</div>
      <div class='line'>Have left me naked to mine enemies.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>We still hope to find a place for the scholar in
politics, but we have given up the search so far as
the ecclesiastic is concerned. Yet in Seneca we have
a man who had mastered all the knowledge of his
time; who was by no means an unsuccessful preacher
of righteousness, and who, nevertheless, was a successful
courtier and statesman during part of his life.
He might have been both to the ending of his days
in peace, had it not been his fate to serve one of the
worst rulers that ever lived. The secret of his undying
fame then is his ability and his whilom position
at the court that ruled the greatest empire of the
world. It is probable that the cause of his exile, at an
age when he had as yet not written very much, so far
as we know, was his prominence in a way that was
distasteful to the emperor Claudius. While there
was nothing in his past life or present conduct to
justify putting him to death, his removal from Rome
seemed desirable to the reigning monarch and his
most influential advisers. But even in exile Seneca
was not a man calmly to permit his enemies to forget
him; nor would his friends suffer him to be forgotten.</p>

<p class='c007'>Notwithstanding his sudden elevation to a position
of great importance in the empire, he seems never to
have lost sight of the fact that he was standing on
the edge of a precipice from which he might be
thrust at any moment, and that he still had need of
all the consolation his philosophy could afford. Boissier
rightly says, “Though praetor and consul he remained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>not the less a sage who gives instruction to
his age; while he was governing the Romans he
preached virtue to them.” And he might have added,
“to himself,” for it is evident from many passages in
his works that he had himself in view no less than
others. He strove to fortify his own soul against
temptations by giving expression to the tenets of
his philosophy, just as men find relief in sorrow by
recording the thoughts that pass through their minds.
We may be certain, too, that to his contemporaries
his speech often sounded bolder and freer than to us
with our inadequate knowledge of the inner life of
the Roman court-circle, and accustomed as we are to
the freedom of criticism to which all our public characters,
not excepting sovereigns, are subject. They
doubtless saw in many of his pithy sayings, allusions,
whether always intentional or not, does not matter, to
occurrences to which we no longer have the key.
And we may be sure that he was not without an abundance
of enemies and detractors. A few of these
have left themselves on record for us. There were,
doubtless, also many persons who were wont to sneer
at the man who professed to find the highest good in
a contemplative life; in devotion to an ideal that differed
so widely from the reality in which he lived; and
who could yet maintain his influence at a court of
which little that was good could be said. Every society
contains a certain number of members who regard
all who endeavor to lead a better life than they
themselves do, or whose ideals are higher than their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>own, as offering a sort of personal challenge or directing
a rebuke at them which they must needs resent.
Seneca was himself conscious that his life and professions
were sometimes irreconcilable. He says: “To
the student who professes his wish and hope to rise
to a loftier grade of virtue, I would answer that this
is my wish also, but I dare not hope it. I am preoccupied
with vices. All I require of myself is, not
to be equal to the best, but only to be better than the
bad.”</p>

<p class='c007'>On the much-debated question of Seneca’s responsibility
for the vices of Nero, Merivale is probably right
in saying that he must soon have become aware that
it was impossible to make even a reasonably virtuous
man out of his pupil. Under such circumstances it
was natural for him to conclude that the best thing
to be done was to allow the youth to indulge in private
vices in order to keep him from injuring others.
The morality he impressed upon Nero, the modern
writer sums up in these words: “Be courteous and
moderate; shun cruelty and rapine; abstain from
blood; compensate yourself with the pleasures of
youth without compunction; amuse yourself, but hurt
no man.” This principle was a dangerous one, as we
now know; but it is easy to be wise after the event.
A philosopher ought to have known that it is never
safe to make a compromise with vice. Our philosopher
did not know it, or, knowing it, was willing to
take the risk.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is doubtless some of his detractors that he has in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>mind in his defense of riches. He can see no harm
in large possessions when they have been honestly, or
at least lawfully, acquired and are properly used. It
may help us to understand his attitude in this matter
if we compare it with that of some of the ministers
of our own day, and with some of the ecclesiastical
dignitaries of the past. Seneca’s philosophy did not
come to him as a divine command. It was the fruit
of his own cogitation in the search for the supreme
good. But there are men in our day, as there have
always been, who are not only members of the church
but preachers of the Gospel, who are both rich
themselves and apologists of the rich. Yet they profess
to be followers of the Son of God; of Him who
taught that it is exceedingly difficult for a rich man
to enter the kingdom of heaven. Seneca did not
profess to seek this kingdom. His search was after
the kingdom of earthly felicity, and he could not see
why riches should be an obstacle to his entering it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Seneca was a good exemplar of the truth of a saying
quoted by Xenophon in his Memorabilia of Socrates
to the effect that even an upright man is sometimes
good, sometimes bad. His writings convey the
impression that their author is always under stress.
The philosophical composure of which he has much to
say, is an aspiration and a hope, not a fruition. When
he speaks of the passions he sees them in their intensity.
He seems to regard all men as either very good or
very bad, and finds the latter class to include the great
body of mankind. He fails to realize that the majority
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>belong to neither extreme. The theater on
which he saw the game of life played probably never
had its counterpart in the world. He stands at one
extreme and Plutarch at the other, just as the social
circle in which each moved and knew best is the antipode
of the other. Both looked too intently and exclusively
upon the merely external. Though Plutarch
judges the average man more correctly, neither
possessed sufficient penetration of intellect to fathom
all the passions that dominate or agitate the soul.
Plutarch was most familiar with the man who is concerned
with the ordinary affairs of life; Seneca knew
best the corrupt crowd that sought to ingratiate itself
into the favor of those who controlled the destinies
of all about them, and, in a measure, of the entire
world. Both were much in the public eye, but the
public was a widely different one. Plutarch sought
to make an impression by the arts of persuasion alone;
Seneca, by all the arts that are within the power of a
resourceful intellect. How much he was in the public
eye is evident from the statement of Tacitus that
his last words were written down and at once made public.
His friends no less than his enemies desired this:
his enemies, because they were eagerly watching for a
final opportunity to prove that this famous preacher
of an exalted philosophy would, after all, prove to be
nothing more than a maker of fine phrases when the
crucial test came; his friends, in order to furnish indubitable
evidence that he had been true to his teachings
to the end.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>It is a noteworthy fact that should always be kept
in mind in the study of the writings of the ancients,
and the career of their statesmen, that there existed
no universal conscience to which men could appeal.
Even the separate states were without any considerable
party among their citizens who shared the conviction
that there exist eternal principles of justice
that demand the recognition of rights for all living
beings, for slaves as well as for brutes, whether they
are in position to enforce these rights or not. There
was an interminable struggle of class with class, each
striving to wrest from the other the privileges they
withheld as long as they could, and finally granted
only so far as they could no longer be withheld. The
political economy of the ancients did not concern
itself with making the public burdens bear as lightly
as possible on each member of the body politic, and
compelling even the most refractory to contribute
their share; the problem was almost invariably how
to raise the largest amount of public revenue. Only
a part,—often but a small part, especially under the
later republic—found its way into the imperial
fisc. Most of it flowed into the coffers of
the farmers of the revenue, and for this reason
their representatives, the publicans or tax-gatherers,
were so thoroughly detested. Their relation to the
citizens was entirely different from the modern officers
of the government who perform the same functions.
Every privilege or alleviation granted by the
governing class was usually wrung from it by force
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>or threats on the part of the subject. Generally
speaking, the empire was more lenient than the republic
because the emperors needed the support of
the mass of their subjects against the turbulent and
avaricious nobility. The spirit of altruism that is
such a powerful force in our day is of very modern
growth. It was introduced into the world by Christianity,
but its development was not rapid. Sociology
as a scientific term is but little older than the present
generation; nor does the study of political economy
as a science extend far into the last century. That
remarkable people, the Jews, have from time immemorial
recognized the claims of a brother in the faith,
upon every other, for aid and sympathy. Their voluntary
contributions for the maintenance of the temple
at Jerusalem and its ritual, no matter how widely
scattered they might be, is the earliest indication of a
spirit of altruism, the recognition of an obligation that
was coextensive with the faith. The Jews, however,
made but a faint impression upon the thought of antiquity.
This is evident from the way they are treated
by Greek writers without exception. They were perhaps
never more numerous or more influential than
during the last two or three centuries <span class='fss'>B. C.</span> and the first
century after Christ, until the destruction of Jerusalem.
Yet Plutarch, who was the most widely read
man of his time, and who might easily have obtained
his knowledge of their doctrines almost at first
hand from the Septuagint, does not show in a single
line that he ever thought this knowledge worth the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>trouble. When he mentions the Jews it is only
to disparage them, and to betray the grossest ignorance
of their religion and their nationality. The
same is true of Seneca and the other Roman writers.
Tacitus, who professes to give an account of their
origin and of some of the tenets of their religion,
shamefully misrepresents both, while he holds the
people up to the scorn of his countrymen. So little
are the most intelligent men often aware of the
occult forces at work in the world, and so ready are
they to pour contempt upon everything that does not
accord with their preconceived opinions!</p>

<p class='c007'>The early Christians, as is well known, were reluctant
to believe that the new doctrines were intended
for Gentiles as well as Jews. Both the
New Testament and some of the church fathers
testify to this fact. Merivale makes it clear that
Tertullian believed that Christianity must always, to
some extent, stand apart from the ordinary march of
events, and that the true faith could only be held by
a chosen few. He does not intend his words to be
understood in their spiritual significance, that many
are called but few chosen, and he makes this plain by
adding that the Roman emperors might themselves
have been Christians, if governments could become
Christian; in other words “mankind in general were
equally incapable of moral renovation and spiritual
conversion.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Though Seneca was, during almost his whole life in
the public eye and lived amid the toil and turbulence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>of the busiest city in the world, he professed a distaste
for crowds. He tries to dissuade those who
value their peace of mind, but especially those who
are truly devoted to philosophy, from seeking popular
applause. He loves to be the center of a circle of
choice spirits, to associate on intimate terms with
men of like aims and tastes with his own. It is almost
exclusively against the vices of the rich and the great
that he declaims. Only in “good society” is he at
home; in fact he seems to know no other, has nothing
in common with any other. He is profoundly ignorant,
with Plutarch, of the fact that society cannot be
reformed from the top or from within. Yet the refinements
of luxury are hateful to him, and from
boyhood to the end of his days he lived a frugal life.</p>

<p class='c007'>How easy it is for Seneca to talk, to express himself
in words whether with tongue or pen, becomes
evident not only from a glance at the subjects upon
which he writes, some of which are of the same tenor
with those discussed by his equally fluent predecessor,
Cicero, but from his own direct testimony. At the beginning
of the Fifth Book on Benefits he tells his readers
that he has virtually exhausted the subject. Yet
he runs on through three more Books, apparently for
no other reason than because he finds pleasure in discussing
every question that has the remotest connection
with the main theme. The result is that the portion
which he considers irrelevant is almost as long
as the treatise proper.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have once or twice in the present essay, touched
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>upon the most prominent feature of the Roman character,
but the phenomenon is so important, contributes
so much to a proper estimate of the career of
Seneca, and goes so far toward reconciling the apparent
or real inconsistencies between his life and his
doctrines, between his words and his deeds, that it is
necessary to dwell upon the point at greater length.
The Romans were, above everything else, men of the
world; men who laid the greatest possible stress on
practical activity in the service of the state; men who
were wholly out of their sphere when this outlet for
their energies was closed to them. Greece gave birth
to many individuals who lived entirely, or at least
chiefly, in the realm of their thoughts; or as Jean
Paul says of the Germans, the air was their domain.
The precincts of abstract speculation lay in a region
never entered by a Roman. A few trod the outer
courts under the guidance of Greeks, but not one
ever penetrated farther. The Romans had no literature
of their own, no music, no pictorial or plastic
arts, no architecture. Though so long under the intellectual
tutelage of Greece, their taste was not refined,
nor was a genuine love of culture inherent in
the nation. It saw no use for these things because
they were not practical; could not be employed in the
service of the government. The occasional efforts of
the emperors and of some of the leading families to
elevate the national taste produced but meager
results. Such being the case, what was there for the
average Roman to do when he had become rich, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>had no public duty to perform, and wanted to “have
a good time”? There is abundant evidence within
our reach to enable us to answer this question. He
plunged headlong into debaucheries so shameful
that the modern pen shrinks from describing them,
and the mind from contemplating them. Fortunes
were sometimes spent on a single banquet. The
Roman baths ministered equally to luxury and licentiousness.
In short, it seems as if all the ingenuity
of the empire had at times been exerted to
the utmost to devise new methods of sensual gratification.</p>

<p class='c007'>But he could not indulge incessantly in bacchanalian
orgies; the jaded body needed some relaxative
that could be found neither in sleep nor in such
business that could not be delegated to a subordinate.
There he regaled himself with the sight of blood.
The huge structures erected for the gladiatorial combats
testify to the Roman passion for these cruel
sports. Every living creature that could be induced
to fight was exhibited in the arena where men and
women took equal delight in the bloody spectacle.
Lecky, in his History of European Morals, sets
forth in graphic colors the pomp and circumstance
with which these horrible exhibitions were given. I
cannot do better than to transcribe his words: “The
gladiatorial games form, indeed, the one feature of
Roman society which to a modern mind is almost inconceivable
in its atrocity. That not only men, but
women, in an advanced period of civilization—men
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>and women who not only professed, but very frequently
acted upon, a high code of morals—should
have made the carnage of men their habitual amusement;
that all this should have continued for centuries,
with scarcely a protest, is one of the most
startling facts in moral history. It is, however, perfectly
normal, and in no degree inconsistent with the
doctrine of natural moral perceptions, while it opens
out fields of ethical enquiry of a very deep, though
painful interest.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The mere desire for novelty impelled the people
to every excess or refinement of barbarity. The simple
combat became at last insipid, and every variety
of atrocity was devised to stimulate the flagging interest.
At one time a bear and a bull, chained together,
rolled in fierce contest along the sand; at another,
criminals dressed in the skins of wild beasts,
were thrown to bulls, which were maddened by red-hot
irons, or by darts tipped with burning pitch.
Four hundred bears were killed in a single day under
Caligula; three hundred on another day under Claudius.
Under Nero, four hundred tigers fought with
bulls and elephants; four hundred bears and three
hundred lions were slaughtered by his soldiers. In
a single day, at the dedication of the Colosseum by
Titus, five thousand animals perished. Under Trajan,
the games continued for one hundred and twenty-three
successive days. Lions, tigers, elephants, rhinoceroses,
hippopotami, giraffes, bulls, stags, even
crocodiles and serpents, were employed to give novelty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>to the spectacle. Nor was any form of human suffering
wanting. The first Gordian, when edile, gave
twelve spectacles, in each of which from one hundred
and fifty to five hundred pair of gladiators appeared.
Eight hundred pair fought at the triumph of
Aurelian. Ten thousand men fought during the
games of Trajan. Nero illumined his gardens during
the night by Christians burning in their pitchy
shirts. Under Domitian, an army of feeble dwarfs
was compelled to fight, and more than once female
gladiators descended to perish in the arena.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“So intense was the craving for blood, that a prince
was less unpopular if he neglected the distribution of
corn than if he neglected the games; and Nero himself,
on account of his munificence in this respect,
was probably the sovereign who was most beloved by
the Roman multitude.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is well for us to look steadily on such facts as
these. They display more vividly than any mere
philosophical disquisition the abyss of depravity into
which it is possible for human nature to sink. They
furnish us with striking proofs of the reality of the
moral progress we have attained, and they enable us
in some degree to estimate the regenerating influence
that Christianity has exercised in the world. For the
destruction of the gladiatorial games is all its work.
Philosophers, indeed, might deplore them, gentle
natures might shrink from their contagion, but to the
multitude they possessed a fascination which nothing
but the new religion could overcome.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>How deeply the virulent poison of inhumanity and
the insatiable thirst for blood had infected the
Roman people is further evident, not only from the
means employed to make these sanguinary spectacles
as fascinating as possible, but also from the impress
they made upon the current phraseology. Lecky says
further: “No pageant has ever combined more powerful
elements of attraction. The magnificent circus,
the gorgeous dresses of the assembled court, the contagion
of a passionate enthusiasm thrilling almost
visibly through the mighty throng, the breathless silence
of expectation, the wild cheers bursting simultaneously
from eighty thousand tongues, and echoing
to the fartherest outskirts of the city, the rapid alternations
of the fray, the deeds of splendid courage
that were manifested, were all well fitted to entrance
the imagination. The crimes and servitude of the
gladiator were for a time forgotten in the blaze of
glory that surrounded him. Representing to the
highest degree that courage which the Romans
deemed the first of virtues, the cynosure of countless
eyes, the chief object of conversation in the metropolis
of the universe, destined, if victorious, to be immortalized
in the mosaic and the sculpture, he not
unfrequently rose to heroic grandeur....
Beautiful eyes, trembling with passion, looked down
upon the fight, and the noblest ladies of Rome, even
the empress herself, had been known to crave the
victor’s love. We read of gladiators lamenting that
the games occurred so seldom, complaining bitterly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>if they were not permitted to descend into the arena,
scorning to fight except with the most powerful antagonists,
laughing aloud at their wounds when
dressed, and at last, when prostrate in the dust, calmly
turning their throats to the sword of the conqueror.
The enthusiasm that gathered round them was so intense
that special laws were found necessary, and
were sometime insufficient, to prevent patricians from
enlisting in their ranks, while the tranquil courage
with which they never failed to die, supplied the
philosopher with his most striking examples. The
severe continence that was required before the combat,
contrasting vividly with the licentiousness of
Roman life, had even invested them with something
of a moral dignity; and it is a singularly suggestive
fact, that, of all pagan characters, the gladiator was
selected by the fathers as the closest approximation
to a Christian model. St. Augustine tells us how
one of his friends, being drawn to the spectacle, endeavored
by closing his eyes to guard against a fascination
that he knew to be sinful. A sudden cry
caused him to break his resolution, and he never
could withdraw his gaze again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Roman people clung with amazing tenacity
to this gruesome sport. Nero instituted, in a private
way, games after the Grecian model, and Hadrian
made a similar effort on a larger scale; but the public
took little interest in them while sturdy Romans
protested against these Hellenic corruptions.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have dwelt somewhat at length on this singular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>institution, both because it was peculiar to ancient
Rome and because, above everything else, it throws
light on the character of its populace. It is true
that men of kindly natures like Virgil and Cicero
condemned these atrocious pastimes, or at least took
no pleasure in them, but their influence produced no
effect on public opinion. Nothing that Seneca has
written is more to his credit than the vigorous language
he employs in denunciation of the gladiatorial
combats.</p>

<p class='c007'>A life devoted to study and speculation was to a
Roman citizen impossible. Cicero, who did more than
any of his countrymen to naturalize Greek philosophy
on Roman soil through the medium of the Latin
language, was a practical statesman. When forced
to retire from the service of the state he longed to
return to its labors, notwithstanding the dangers to
be incurred. Livy and Virgil devoted their lives
almost exclusively to the glorification of the past in
extolling the heroes by whose toil, endurance, and
self-sacrifice, the Rome of their day had become
what it was. Though in a sense living in retirement,
their thoughts were none the less upon the state;
their time and talents not the less devoted to its
service. To a Roman the state embodied almost
everything worth living for; asceticism was impossible
for him. Even when not actively engaged
in public affairs he found pleasure in observing, at
close range, the machinery of government in action.
He longed to live and move in the strife and turmoil
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>of the capital. We need not wonder that Ovid, in
exile, was ready to submit with cheerful alacrity to
any moral indignity, and to humiliate himself in the
dust before his emperor, would he but permit him to
return to the city which his spirit had never left.
Seneca’s conduct, when in banishment, was even less
to his credit than that of Ovid, inasmuch as he professed
to be governed by far higher principles. He
thought he was a philosopher, yet when compelled to
live in Corsica where he had all his time to devote to
study and meditation, he was wretched in the extreme;
belittled himself by the most degrading exhibition
of servility; did not scruple to stoop to the
most shameful falsehoods and the most disgusting
flattery in order to bring about his recall. His encomium
on solitude, and his aversion to crowds, if
they are anything more than mere theory, are the
result of larger experience and of deeper insight into
the human heart. Yet it is hardly open to doubt
that he could have gone into voluntary retirement at
any period of his life, except perhaps near its close.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has been said of the emperor Marcus Aurelius,
that his mind was more Greek than Roman. While it
is true that he loved philosophy, and studied it daily,
he did so in the belief that in this way he could the
better prepare his mind and heart to perform the
duties which his exalted station imposed upon him.
He seems never to have seriously entertained the
thought that it was in his power at all times to lay
down his official burdens in order to follow his natural
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>inclinations. His highest ideal of virtue was to
cultivate and strengthen his sense of duty; but this
duty was primarily political.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is little doubt that the conspicuous place
occupied by the state in the mind of every Roman
citizen prepared the way for the deification of the
emperors, a form of adulation that in the course of
time wrought untold mischief, and led to the most
abject servility on the part of men of whom one
would have expected better things. Baumgarten
devotes many pages to a discussion of this curious
feature of Roman politics. In the nature of the
case this deification had no regard whatever to the
personal character of the sovereign. It elevated him
to the skies, solely as the personification of the largest
possible power entrusted to a mortal. When in
the course of time all the functions of the government
were concentrated in the hands of a single
individual, it was natural that he should become an
object of worship, at least in a sense, even during his
lifetime, and as a matter of course placed among the
gods at his death. We shall find this transition
easy if we consider further the character of the gods
of antiquity. They were not distinguished from
mortals by higher attributes, but only by the possession
of greater power. A god, in the popular
estimation, was not necessarily any better than a
man—he was only stronger. His good-will was to
be gained and his ill-will averted by precisely the
same means that were employed in the case of men.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>The Roman gods were, in a far larger measure than
those of the Greeks, personifications of abstract
qualities. There was thus a wide scope for projecting
into their character the salient traits of the
worshiper.</p>

<p class='c007'>The gods, then, being an abstraction, and the state
being the mightiest visible representation of human
power, it required no great effort of the imagination
to regard its head as divine, in the sense which the
Romans attached to the term. The unthinking multitude
naturally fell in with the ideas of their leaders,
and even the better class of men rarely protested
because they considered the ceremony of little moment,
or because protests would have been unavailing.</p>

<p class='c007'>Strangely, too, the belief in fate, in an inevitable
destiny, did much to paralize the free action of many
of the bravest men. The fate of the republic, the
destiny of the Roman people, regarded as an immutable
law of nature, the utter insignificance of the
individual either expressed or implied, are ideas that
figure prominently in the literature of ancient Rome.
It has been truly said that Rome attained its greatness
without great men. Almost from its remotest
beginnings it was like an organism in which each
separate cell, though incapable of life by itself, performs
its function as part of a whole and contributes
to its life and growth. In this case the cell, as we
may designate each individual moral entity, though
conscious in a sense of a life apart, was powerless to
modify the whole organism.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>To what extent the Roman emperors took their
apotheosis seriously we have scant means of knowing.
It is well established that a few of them regarded it
as a huge joke. But it is beyond question that on
the great mass of the people it had a most deleterious
effect. How could it be otherwise, when some of
them reached the lowest depths of degradation to
which human nature could sink? When the monarch
in his official capacity was recognized not only as
the political and military head of the government
but also its divine head, it is easy to imagine what
the effect of such a recognition must be upon the
average Roman, in contracting his spiritual outlook.
As long as the gods were mere abstract qualities,
or even to some extent personal beings like those
of the Greeks, there was a sort of indistinctness
in which they were veiled that did not invite
imitation. But a deified emperor was, or had been,
a creature of flesh and blood; no matter what he
might do, there would be many ready to tread in
his footsteps, so far as they could. The pernicious
influence of the ancient mythology engaged the
attention of thoughtful men from the remotest times.
How much worse, then, would this influence be when
the vilest that tradition reported of the gods was
actually done by men in flesh and blood. “Like
priest, like people,” is a true saying even when both
priest and people are pagans.</p>

<p class='c007'>Aside from the restraints of religion, there is, in
modern times, in all civilized countries, a certain restraining
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>influence exercised by public opinion that
keeps the rich, who are inclined to a lax personal
morality, within reasonable bounds. But so far as we
can discover, the inhibitive force of public opinion in
Rome upon the individual in the matter of ethics
was very slight, especially under the empire. It is
plain then where a debauched public sentiment
placed no check upon any form of vice from without,
and but few individuals yielded to moral restraints
from within, the condition of society was such that it
could hardly have been worse.</p>

<p class='c007'>We are sometimes inclined to wonder that so few
protests were made by enlightened Romans against
the deification of the emperors. The explanation
may be found in the prevailing rationalism of the
age. To the majority of those men one religion was
just as good as another, and all religions were but
forms of superstition. The persecutions directed
against the early Christians were urged on the
general ground that the failure to follow the multitude
was a mark of treason against the government,
and for this reason the best men were naturally the
instigators. To perform the religious functions enjoined
by the state was regarded as a mark of loyalty;
to refuse, the badge of disloyalty. It is not necessary
to go back to ancient Rome and to heathen religions
to find parallels for treating the externals of worship
as matters of indifference, or for requiring the subject,
under penalties, to conform to the creed of the
sovereign.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>When we come to speak of the relation of Seneca
to Christianity, but especially of his conversion by
St. Paul, a thesis laboriously defended by more than
one modern writer, we cannot do better than to
transcribe a passage from Merivale setting forth
clearly the courses that led men into a very natural
error. After calling attention to the fact that both
Seneca and Paul were moral reformers, he proceeds:
“There is so much in their principles, so much even
in their language, which agrees together, so that one
has been thought, though it must be allowed without
adequate reason, to have borrowed directly from the
other. But the philosopher, be it remembered, discoursed
to a large and not inattentive audience, and
surely the soil was not all unfruitful on which this
seed was scattered, when he proclaimed that <i>God
dwells not in temples of wood or stone, nor wants
the ministration of human hands; that He has no
delight in the blood of victims; that He is near to all
His creatures; that His spirit resides in men’s
hearts; that all men are truly His offspring; that
we are members of one body, which is God or nature;
that men must believe in God before they can approach
Him; that the true service of God is to be
like unto Him; that all men have sinned, and none
performed all the works of the law; that God is no
respecter of nations, ranks, or conditions, but all,
barbarian and Roman, bond and free, are alike under
His all-seeing providence.</i> St. Paul enjoined
submission and obedience even to the tyranny of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>Nero, and Seneca fosters no ideas subversive of political
subjection. Endurance is the paramount virtue
of the Stoic. To forms of government the wise
man was wholly indifferent; they were among the
external circumstances above which his spirit soared
in serene self-contemplation. We trace in Seneca
no yearning for a restoration of political freedom,
nor does he ever point to the senate, after the manner
of the patriots of the day, as a legitimate check to
the autocracy of the despot. The only mode, in his
view, of tempering tyranny is to educate the tyrant
himself in virtue. His was the self-denial of the
Christians, but without their anticipated compensation.
It seems impossible to doubt that in his
highest flights of rhetoric—and no man ever recommended
the unattainable with a finer grace—Seneca
must have felt that he was laboring to build up a
house without foundations; that his system, as Caius
said of his style, was sand without lime. He was
surely not unconscious of the inconsistency of his
own position, as a public man and a minister, with
the theories to which he had wedded himself; and of
the impossibility of preserving in it the purity of his
character as a philosopher or a man. He was aware
that in the existing state of society at Rome, wealth
was necessary to men high in station; wealth alone
could retain influence, and a poor minister became
at once contemptible. Both Cicero and Seneca
were men of many weaknesses, and we remark them
the more because both were pretenders to unusual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>strength of character: but while Cicero lapsed into
political errors, Seneca cannot be absolved of actual
crime. Nevertheless, if we may compare the greatest
masters of Roman wisdom together, the Stoic will
appear, I think, the more earnest of the two, the
more anxious to do his duty for its own sake, the
more sensible of the claims of mankind upon him for
such precepts of virtuous living as he had to give.
In an age of unbelief and compromise, he taught that
Truth was positive and Virtue objective. He conceived,
what never entered Cicero’s mind, the idea of
improving his fellow creatures; he had, what Cicero
had not, a heart for conversion to Christianity.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Notwithstanding the many points of contact between
the doctrines of the New Testament and the
teachings of Seneca, no competent judge now holds
that he was a Christian. The wonder is that there
should ever have arisen any serious controversy on
the subject. The very fact that Seneca’s faith underwent
no change from first to last ought to be decisive.
He did not pass through the experience of
conversion; he shows no vicissitudes of intellectual
or moral growth; he never wavered in his faith in philosophy,
and in the power of man to attain the supreme
good by mere force of will. Yet Seneca is, to
the Christian, unquestionably, the most interesting
personality that heathen antiquity has produced. His
philosophy and his morality show, in a striking way,
that a man may approach very close to the boundary
line of Christianity without crossing it; without even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>knowing what is before him. The best thought of
the age clearly proves that Greek philosophy had, in
a sense, prepared a few noble minds for the reception
of the ethical and altruistic precepts of the Gospel;
but it was in no sense the harbinger of its spiritual
doctrines.</p>

<p class='c007'>It remains yet to consider briefly an institution
which, while not peculiar to Rome, was, nevertheless,
here characterized by some features that were unique
in their influences for evil. Slavery rested like a
horrible incubus upon the ancient world, though few
persons seem to have been aware of it. It placed a
curse upon labor and almost prevented the development
of the mechanic arts. It seriously impeded the
growth of the moral sentiments by the hindrances it
placed in the way of free discussion, and by the opportunities
it afforded the basely inclined for the
gratification of carnal lusts. It placed a large part
of the population virtually beyond the range of human
sympathy by branding the expression of such
sympathy as a symptom of treason. While it did
these things everywhere, in Rome it made a people
that were naturally coarse and brutal still more so,
by placing within the easy reach of every slave-owner
helpless objects upon which he could vent his rage,
and whose services he could exploit in the most unfeeling
manner. A lurid light is thrown on the barbarity
of the Romans toward their slaves by an occurrence
that took place in the later years of Seneca.
A plain statement of the facts is more impressive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>than many pages of theory. A prefect of the city,
Pedanius Secundus by name, was murdered by one
of his slaves and the criminal could not be apprehended.
According to law, all the bondmen of the
murdered man, four hundred in number, were to be
put to death. The populace, to their honor be it
said, more humane than the senators, raised a tumult
of protest against the execution of the sentence.
Their sympathy availed nothing; the unhappy victims
were led away to die. One of the senators even
proposed a decree that all the freedmen belonging to
the household of the late prefect should be transported
beyond the confines of Italy. But the emperor,
and that emperor was Nero, more humane than
the optimates, alleged that the laws were already
severe enough, and that it would be cruel to add to
their severity by fresh enactments. The decree of
expulsion was not passed. Yet Tacitus, from whom
this narrative is taken, a writer who never tires of
lamenting the degeneracy of his age, has not a word
of compassion for the unfortunate sufferers, nor a
syllable of condemnation for an atrocious law.</p>

<p class='c007'>Still it must be said that some of the Roman philosophers,
especially Cicero and Seneca, lay stress in
their writings, upon the universal brotherhood of
man. They have much to say about the intrinsic
worth of the human soul. While these ideas are
largely borrowed from the Greeks, or at least suggested
by Greek philosophers, the Romans are singularly
eloquent in proclaiming them. But slavery is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>never attacked by name. It is doubtful whether a
passage can be found in any Greek or Roman writer
explicitly asserting that it is wrong for one man to
hold another in bondage. This may be due to the
conviction that such a doctrine would be extremely
dangerous among a large servile population, even if
the government allowed entire freedom of speech.
The New Testament is almost silent about slavery.
Its authors did not wish to give utterance to any views
that could be used by their enemies as the basis for a
charge of disaffection with the “powers that be.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Again, slavery in some form was universal. Servitude
was held to be the proper condition of a large
part of the human race. No man who lived during
the existence of the Roman empire would have ventured
to predict the ultimate downfall of slavery. It
is interesting to note in this connection that Basil
Hall, writing as late as 1828, while admitting everything
that could be alleged on the evils of slavery,
thought that to do away with it seemed “so completely
beyond the reach of any human exertions
that I consider the abolition of slavery as one of the
most profitless of all possible subjects of discussion.”</p>

<p class='c007'>On the supposition, then, that slavery must continue
indefinitely, if it could ever be abolished, it
was the duty of the philanthropist to do what he
could to ameliorate the condition of the servile class
by educating their masters in the principles of a humane
philosophy, rather than to incur the risk of
making it worse by the suggestion of emancipation.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>If the good man is kind to his beast, he cannot fail
to treat kindly his bondman. It does not seem inconsistent
with the general tenor of Seneca’s writings
to assume that he thought the best way to mitigate
the condition of the slaves was to indoctrinate their
owners with a philosophy that would accord to them
kind treatment, rather than to seek to bring about
their liberation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Besides, the slaves themselves were not often conscious
of their unfortunate legal status. The best
they desired for themselves was that they might fall
into the hands of a good master. That such men
were not altogether wanting, even among the Romans,
is evident from the many instances of rare devotion
shown by their slaves.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is one of the surprising things in the history of
mankind that the progress of the anti-slavery sentiment
was so rapid when the cause of the slave had
obtained a hearing before the bar of public conscience.
Slavery had existed from time immemorial.
The wrongs it condoned, the evils entailed upon its
victims, attracted but little attention until the close
of the last century. Within less than a hundred
years after the agitation had begun there was not a
slave recognized as such by law in Christendom.
The contemplation of this fact may well teach political
prophets to be careful in their predictions as to
what will or will not happen in the future.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c007'>In the foregoing essay I have, for the most part
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>omitted such biographical data as may be found in
any encyclopedia, and have confined myself chiefly
to a study of the society in which Seneca moved,
and to a consideration of some of the leading characteristics
of the age in which he lived. Every man
should be judged by his times, for no man is uninfluenced
by them. It is only men of the strongest
character that rise far above the manners and
thoughts of their contemporaries. Seneca was not
one of these. Though endowed with a penetrating
intellect and strong moral convictions he sometimes
yielded to temptations against the protest of his
better judgment. He compelled his intellect to
sanction or at least to excuse conduct that he felt to
be unworthy of the philosophy he professed and
taught. Yet after making all due allowance for his
shortcomings, I am persuaded that one cannot
long study his writings and his career without reaching
the conviction that among the great men of
Rome none towered above him in moral grandeur
and but few surpassed him in intellectual stature.
If I may be allowed to express a personal opinion
I do not hesitate to affirm that in the first thousand
years of its history no more interesting and attractive
character lived and died in the City of the
Seven Hills than the philosopher Seneca.</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='chap2'></a>
The following is a list of Seneca’s extant works:</p>

<p class='c008'><i>De Providentia</i>, (On Providence).</p>

<p class='c003'><i>De Constantia Sapientis</i>, (On the Constancy of the Sage).</p>

<p class='c003'><i>De Ira</i>, (On Anger).</p>

<p class='c003'><i>De Vita beata</i>, (On a happy life).</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span><i>De Otio</i>, (On Leisure).</p>

<p class='c003'><i>De Tranquillitate Animi</i>, (On Peace of Mind).</p>

<p class='c003'><i>De Brevitate Vitae</i>, (On the Shortness of Life).</p>

<p class='c003'><i>De Beneficiis</i>, (On Beneficence).</p>

<p class='c003'><i>De Clementia</i>, (On Clemency).</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Ad Marciam de Consolatione</i>, (A Letter of Condolence to Marcia).</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Ad Polybium de Consolatione</i>, (A Letter of Condolence to Polybius).</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Ad Helviam matrem de Consolatione.</i> (A Letter of Condolence to
his mother Helvia).</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Apocolocynthosis</i>, (Pumpkinfication, as it may be translated by
a parody on Deification; or we may call it Pumpkinosis to
correspond with Apotheosis).</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Epistolae Morales ad Lucilium</i>, (Letters to Lucilius on the Conduct
of Life).</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Quaestiones Naturales</i>, (Questions relating to Physical Phenomena).
This is the only work of the kind belonging to Latin
literature. During the Middle Ages it was much used as a
text-book.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the Charpentier-Lemaistre edition the letters to
Lucilius fill the first volume and a little more than
half of the second. The first Book on Beneficence is
in the third volume; the remainder with the Problems
in Physics fill the fourth and last. The smaller
treatises occupy the rest of the four volumes. A
number of Tragedies with Greek titles are also attributed
to our Seneca, probably with justice.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>Note:—To translate Seneca adequately is not an easy task.
While his meaning is usually plain, the modern reader is not in
all cases certain that he clearly apprehends the exact signification
of his words when taken separately. He is thus in danger
of reading into them ideas that savor more of modern theology
than the author intended,—a common fault of interpreters.
It has been demonstrated that Seneca knew nothing of the
Gospels directly, yet he has often been claimed as a Christian.
Evidently, then, there must be a good deal in his writings that
can be used to support such a claim. Attention has already
been called to his use of <i>caro</i>. He seems also to be the first
Roman who uses Providentia to designate an intelligent guide
and guardian of the affairs of the world. There are other
terms to which he gives a signification not found in the profane
writers of ancient Rome.</p>

<p class='c003'>But the chief obstacle the translator has to contend against
is his diction. This is highly rhetorical and very difficult to
transfer into another language, unless the translator has at
command all the resources of his mother tongue. Such a
wealth of resources, I do not hesitate to confess, is not within
my reach. If a translation is to make the same impression on
the reader or hearer that is made by the original, it is as
important to preserve the peculiarities of a writer’s style as to
render accurately the meaning of the separate words. While
I flatter myself that I have been fairly successful in the interpretation
of Seneca’s words, I am not equally sanguine as to
his diction. I believe, however, that I have in no case strayed
very far afield and that the reading of the following pages will
convey not only a fairly correct idea of what Seneca thought
on many important problems, but also of the manner in which
he expressed himself. I hope at some future time, if life and
health are vouchsafed to me, to prepare a complete translation
of Seneca’s moral writings.</p>

</div>
<h3 class='c013'>FROM THE LETTERS TO LUCILIUS.</h3>
<p class='c006'>A holy spirit dwells within us, the observer and
keeper of the evil and the good; it treats us just as it
is treated by us.</p>

<p class='c007'>If you do what is right, let all men know it; if
what is wrong, does it matter that no one knows it,
since you know it yourself? O what a wretched man
you are if you disregard such a witness!</p>

<p class='c007'>The human mind has come down from the spirit
that dwells on high.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fortune exempts many from punishment; from
fear, no one.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is natural for those who have done wrong to be
afraid.</p>

<p class='c007'>The light is irksome to a bad conscience.</p>

<p class='c007'>The guilty have sometimes the good fortune not to
be found out; never the certainty of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Good precepts, if you often reflect upon them, will
profit you equally with good examples.</p>

<p class='c007'>If thou wouldst gain the favor of the gods, be good.</p>

<p class='c007'>He adequately worships the gods who imitates them.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>It suffices God that he be worshiped and loved; love
cannot be mixed with fear.</p>

<p class='c007'>What thou hast learned, confirm by doing.</p>

<p class='c007'>A great and holy spirit, it is true, holds converse
with us, but it cleaves to its origin.</p>

<p class='c007'>Let the young reverence and look up to their teachers.</p>

<p class='c007'>How wisely you live is an important matter: not,
how long.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not a good thing to live; it is, to live wisely.</p>

<p class='c007'>He who would live for himself must live for others.</p>

<p class='c007'>He who has much covets more.</p>

<p class='c007'>No one is worthy of God save him who contemns
riches.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dare to contemn riches and thus to make thyself
worthy of God.</p>

<p class='c007'>The shortest road to riches is to contemn riches.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not he who has little but he who covets more is
poor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thin is the texture of a lie; it is easily seen through
if closely examined.</p>

<p class='c007'>The praise is not in the deed but in the way it is
done.</p>

<p class='c007'>To be master of one’s self is the greatest mastery.</p>

<p class='c007'>One cause of the evils of our time is that we live
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>after the example of others. We are not guided by
reason but led astray by custom.</p>

<p class='c007'>Money never made anybody rich.</p>

<p class='c007'>Why did God create the world? He is good; a
good being feels no aversion to anything that is good.
Therefore He made the world as good as possible.
<i>Quoted from Plato.</i></p>

<p class='c007'>Some of our time is filched from us, some is stolen
outright, some passes unnoticed. But most reprehensible
of all things is to lose it by mere negligence; and
if you will note carefully, men spend a great part of
life in doing evil, the greatest part in doing nothing
the whole of it doing something else than they ought.
Whom will you name that places any value on time?
Who prizes a day? Who realizes that he is dying daily?
For we err when we regard death as something in the
future; a great part of it has already passed; the portion
of our life that is behind us, death holds. Do,
therefore, Lucilius, what you write that you are doing,
husband every hour; you will be less dependent upon
to-morrow if you seize to-day. Everything else belongs
to others, time only is ours.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is a great difference between not wanting to
sin and not knowing how.</p>

<p class='c007'>If thou wouldst get rid of thy vices keep out of
bad company.</p>

<p class='c007'>He worships God who knows Him.</p>

<p class='c007'>No one commits wrongs for himself alone; he communicates
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>them to others and is in turn led astray by
others.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our minds are dazzled when they look upon truth.</p>

<p class='c007'>No virtue remains hidden, and it suffers no damage
by having been hidden.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nature has given to all the fundamental principles
and seeds of virtue.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nature does not make us virtuous; it is an art to become
good.</p>

<p class='c007'>If what you are doing is right, all men may know it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The reward of all the virtues is in the virtues
themselves. The recompense of a good deed is to
have done it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Virtue alone brings lasting and sure happiness.</p>

<p class='c007'>He errs who thinks the gods intentionally inflict
injuries on any one; they cannot do so; they can
neither receive nor do injury.</p>

<p class='c007'>So live with men as if God saw thee; so talk with
God as if men heard thee.</p>

<p class='c007'>God has no need of ministering servants: He Himself
ministers to men; is present everywhere and in
everything.</p>

<p class='c007'>The gods extend a helping hand to those who
would rise. Do you wonder that man goes to the
gods? God comes to men, and what is more, He
comes into men. No mind is good without God.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>All men, if they are traced to their first origin, are
from the gods.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every day, every hour, reminds us of our nothingness
and, by some fresh admonition, warns those of
their frailty who are prone to forget it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Give heed to each day as if it were your whole life.
Nothing will so much enable you to exercise control
over yourself in all things as to think often of the
uncertainty and brevity of life.</p>

<p class='c007'>You will grant that the greatest piety toward the
gods is a characteristic of a good man; and so whatever
may befall him he will bear with equanimity,
for he will know that it has happened in harmony
with that divine law by which all things are governed.</p>

<p class='c007'>No one is strong enough to rise by his own strength;
every man needs some one to extend a hand, some
one to lead him.</p>

<p class='c007'>So let us live, so let us talk, that our destiny may
find us prepared and ready to follow it. Great is the
soul that has yielded itself to God; on the other
hand, that one is cowardly and degenerate that resists,
that finds fault with the order of the world, and is
more ready to set the the gods right than itself.</p>

<p class='c007'>We ought to have before our minds some one
whom we revere; some one whose influence makes
even our most secret thoughts holier.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>Long is a way by precepts; short and effectual, by
examples.</p>

<p class='c007'>Weaker minds, however, have need of some one to
go before who shall say, “This avoid, this do.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The community of which we form a part is very
much like an arch built of stone; it would at
once fall down if one did not support another.</p>

<p class='c007'>We are members of an immense body. Nature
begat us as kinsmen, since it formed us of the same
elements and for the same end.</p>

<p class='c007'>What is it that draws us in one direction when we
would go in another, that urges us on when we want
to resist, that strives against our desires and does
not permit us to do what we purpose?</p>

<p class='c007'>If thou wishest to be loved, love!</p>

<p class='c007'>No one is free that is the slave of his body.</p>

<p class='c007'>We ought to live in this thought: I was not born
for a corner only; my country is this entire world.</p>

<p class='c007'>The beginning of salvation is the knowledge of sin.
<i>Quoted from Epicurus.</i></p>

<p class='c007'>Philosophy sheds its light upon all men.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is so difficult for us to get well because we do not
know that we are sick.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is the strongest evidence that our mind is directed
toward its own improvement when we see
faults that we had not before observed.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>It is an infirmity of mind not to be able to bear
riches.</p>

<p class='c007'>To live right is in the power of everybody.</p>

<p class='c007'>The acknowledgement of a fault is the beginning
of a better life.</p>

<p class='c007'>He who does not admit his proneness to do wrong
has no desire to be corrected. You must recognize
your errors before you can correct them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ancients held the first requisite of repentance
to be an examination of one’s self, especially since
without this, life would not be worth living.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is no vice without some excuse.</p>

<p class='c007'>You ask me what you should particularly avoid.
(I answer,) a crowd. You cannot with safety to yourself
mingle in a large company. I must verily confess
my own weakness. I never bring back the same
character that I took with me; something which I
had banished, returns; something else that I had
quieted, is aroused.... But nothing is so damaging
to a good character as to spend much time at public
spectacles, for with the pleasure we receive vices the
more easily creep in unawares.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is a large part of goodness to desire to become
good.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is a certain fitness in the feeling of sorrow;
this the sage ought to heed, and just as in everything
else so in grief there is a proper mean.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>What fate did not give it did not take away.</p>

<p class='c007'>To obey God is liberty.</p>

<p class='c007'>No one is out of the reach of the temptation
of vice unless he has banished it wholly from his
breast; and no one has banished it wholly until he has
put wisdom in its stead.</p>

<p class='c007'>Great is the praise if man is helpful to man. We
admonish you to extend a hand to the shipwrecked; to
point out the way to the lost; to share your bread
with the hungry.</p>

<p class='c007'>No one ever renders a service to another without
also rendering a service to himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>Often what is given is a small matter; what follows
from it, a great one.</p>

<p class='c007'>When we reason upon the immortality of the soul,
we do not regard as of little weight the universal
belief of men who either fear or revere the gods of the
lower world.</p>

<p class='c007'>That day which thou dreadest as if it were thy last
is the day of the birth into eternity.</p>

<p class='c007'>A time will come that shall unite us and bring us
into each other’s company.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then shall our soul have reason to rejoice because,
freed from this darkness in which it is involved, it
shall see the light, no longer with feeble vision, but
in all the brightness of day, and it will have returned
to its own heaven since it will again occupy the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>place which belongs to it by right of birth. Its
origin calls it on high.</p>

<p class='c007'>Let another begin a quarrel, but let reconciliation
begin with thee.</p>

<p class='c007'>What else is nature than God and the divine reason
that permeates the whole world and all its parts.
Whithersoever thou turnest thou wilt see Him before
thee; there is no place where He is not; He Himself
fills all His work.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every crime is committed before the deed is done.</p>

<p class='c007'>The human mind has come down from the spirit
that dwells on high.</p>

<p class='c007'>Believe me, the creator of this vast universe, whoever
he may have been, whether it was a god, master
of everything, whether it was an incorporeal intelligence
able to bring forth the most brilliant marvels,
whether it was a divine spirit diffused with equal energy
in the smallest and the largest things, whether
it was destiny and an immutable concatenation of
causes linked together: this sovereign potentate did
not wish to leave us dependent upon any one else
even in the smallest matters.</p>

<p class='c007'>Stars shall impinge upon stars and all matter that
now delights us with its beautiful order will burn in
one huge conflagration.</p>

<p class='c007'>How often he who refuses pardon to others begs it
for himself!</p>

<p class='c007'>It is base to say one thing and mean another; it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>is baser to write one thing and mean another.</p>

<p class='c007'>A wise man will pardon an injury, though it be
great, and if he can do it without breach of piety and
fidelity, that is, if the whole injury pertains to himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>As far as thou canst, accuse thyself, try thyself, discharge
the office, first of a prosecutor, then of a judge,
lastly of an intercessor.</p>

<p class='c007'>We can never quarrel enough with our vices, which,
I beseech thee, persecute perpetually. Cast from
thee everything that corrupts the heart; and if thou
canst not otherwise get rid of it, spare not the heart
itself.</p>
<h3 class='c014'>FROM DE BENEFICIIS.</h3>
<p class='c006'>Nature is not without God nor is God without nature.
Both are the same and their functions are the
same. So, too, nature, destiny, fortune, are all the
names of the same God.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is the mark of a noble and generous soul to be
helpful, to do good; he who confers favors, imitates
the gods.</p>

<p class='c007'>Beneficence always makes haste; what one does
willingly one does quickly.</p>

<p class='c007'>We owe no thanks for a favor that has for a long
time adhered to the hands of the giver, as it were;
which he seems to have let go with reluctance and
which one might almost say had been wrested from
him.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>Those favors are most gratifying to us that are deliberately
and willingly offered, and in connection
with which the only hesitancy is on the part of the
recipient.</p>

<p class='c007'>I do not make the favors I confer a matter of public
record.</p>

<p class='c007'>He who intends to be grateful ought to think
about requiting a favor as soon as he receives it.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is the law of beneficence between two persons:
the one should forthwith forget that he has
given; the other should never forget that he has received.</p>

<p class='c007'>You buy from the physician a thing that is above
price, life and health; from the teacher of belles-lettres,
acquaintance with the liberal arts. Yet it is not the
value of these things that you pay for but their pains,
because when they are serving us they give up their
private business to devote themselves to us.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sun rises for the evil also.</p>

<p class='c007'>God has given certain benefactions to all men, and
from which none are excluded.</p>

<p class='c007'>Who is so wretched, so despised, who born to so
hard and sorrowful a destiny that he has never perceived
the munificence of the gods? Seek out even
those who bewail their fate and who are always complaining,
you will not find among the entire number
one who has not experienced the beneficence of heaven;
there is not one for whom there has not flowed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>something from the most inexhaustible of all fountains.</p>

<p class='c007'>Add, now, that external circumstances do not coerce
the gods, but their sempiternal will is their law.
They have established an order of events which they
do not change. The gods never repent of their first
purpose.</p>

<p class='c007'>Beneficence consists not in what is done or given,
but in the spirit of the doer or giver.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is a most glorious work to save even the unwilling
and refractory.</p>

<p class='c007'>The door to virtue is closed to no one; it is open to
all, admits all; virtue invites everybody, free-born,
freedmen, slaves, kings and exiles. It selects neither
class nor condition, it seeks the man only.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nature directs us to do good to all men whether
bond or free, free-born or emancipated slaves. Wherever
there is a human being, there is a place for
beneficence.</p>

<p class='c007'>He who reasons thus (like Epicurus), does not hear
the voices of supplicants and the prayers offered
everywhere, in public and private, with hands outstretched
toward heaven. This could not be, nor is it
possible that all men should have willingly consented
to the folly of addressing deaf divinities and powerless
gods, if they had not recognized their benefactions,
sometimes given spontaneously, sometimes in
answer to prayer, always great, timely, averting by
their intervention impending disasters.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>
  <h3 class='c013'>FROM VARIOUS SOURCES.</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>It is easy to form the mind while it is still tender;
but it is difficult to root out those vices that have
grown up with it.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is a great thing to know when to speak and when
to be silent.</p>

<p class='c007'>The vices of others we have before our eyes; our
own, behind our backs.</p>

<p class='c007'>Use your ears oftener than your tongue.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nothing is more out of place in him who is inflicting
punishment than anger.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not the issue of a thing that ought to be
taken into account, but the purpose.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every crime is committed before the deed is done.</p>

<p class='c007'>To cupidity nothing is enough; to nature even a
little is enough.</p>

<p class='c007'>Vice takes possession of us unconsciously; virtue
is difficult to find, and we need a guide and teacher.
Vices are learned without a teacher.</p>

<p class='c007'>Stars shall impinge upon stars and all matter that
now delights us with its beautiful order shall burn
in one huge conflagration.</p>

<p class='c007'>All that is best can neither be given to men nor
taken from them.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are two things, the most precious of all,
that attend us whithersoever we turn our steps: common
nature and personal virtue. These things are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>so, believe me, because they were so willed by the
creator of the universe, whether it is that God who
controls everything, or incorporeal reason, the artificer
of great works, or the divine spirit that pervades
equally the greatest and the smallest things.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the dead have any feeling, the soul of my
brother, now set free from a long imprisonment, is at
length in the full enjoyment of his freedom and his
majority; he beholds with delight the nature of
things and looks down upon human affairs from his
high abode; but things divine, the causes of which
he so long sought out in vain, he now beholds at
close range. Why then do I pine away in sorrow for
him who is either blessed or not all? To mourn for
one who is in bliss is envy; for one who is not, folly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Borne on high, he soars among beatified spirits,
and a sanctified company welcomes him—the
Scipios, the Catos, released by the beneficence of
death. There thy father devotes himself to his
grandson, resplendent in the new light even though
in that place all are known to each. He explains to
him the motions of the stars around him; not from
conjectures, but, versed in the knowledge of all things,
he gladly inducts him into the arcana of nature.</p>

<p class='c007'>If you will believe those who have looked more
deeply into the truth, our whole life is a punishment.</p>

<p class='c007'>For those who sail this sea so stormy, so exposed to
every tempest, there is no harbor except death.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>He now enjoys a serene and cloudless heaven.
From this humble and low abode, he has sped swiftly
into that region, wherever it may be, where souls,
freed from their chains, are received into the abode of
the blest. He now roams about at will, and beholds
with supremest delight all that is good in the universe....
He has not left us; he has gone
before.</p>

</div>
<p class='c015'><span class='sc'>Note</span>:—This monograph is addressed to the same Lucilius,
procurator of Sicily, to whom Seneca also dedicates his letters
and his Problems in Physics. The date of composition is not
known, but it probably belongs to the later years of the
author’s life. The opening sentences seem to make it a part of
a larger work on ethics, or rather of a theodicy, which was either
never completed or has not come down to us. This is a serious
loss both to us and to Seneca: to us, because such a work would
doubtless have placed before us a complete theory of human
conduct as conceived by a man who was thoroughly conversant
with the motives that dominate men; to Seneca, because
it would in all probability have explained if not justified some of
the inconsistencies that have so sadly marred his career. Indeed
the fundamental proposition of the essay is inconsistent,
since the conclusion does not follow from the premises. For if
the patient endurance of tribulation is the supreme test of a
good man, how is he justified in avoiding that test, as our author
proposes, by taking his own life?</p>
<h3 class='c013'>I.</h3>
<p class='c006'>You have asked me, Lucilius, why it is, if the
world is governed by a Providence, that so many misfortunes
befall good men. To this an answer would
more properly be given in a work in which I should
undertake to prove that a Providence presides over
the affairs of men, and that God dwells among us.
But since you deem it best to take a small portion of
the whole subject, and to settle this single disputed
question, the main proposition meanwhile being left
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>untouched, I shall undertake a case of little difficulty:
I shall plead the cause of the gods.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. It is superfluous to show at the present time
that so great a work does not stand fast and firm
without an overseer; that the regular course of the
heavenly bodies is not a fortuitous concourse of atoms;
that those objects which chance puts in motion are
subject to frequent disturbances and sudden collisions;
that this harmonious velocity is under the
sway of an eternal law governing everything on land
and sea, no less than the brilliant luminaries which
shine according to a prearranged plan; that this order
is not the result of elements moving about at random,
neither can fortuitous aggregations of matter
cohere with such art that the immense mass of the
earth remains motionless while beholding the rapid
gyrations of the heavenly bodies about itself; that
the seas poured into the valleys to fructify the soil
never feel any increase from rivers; or that enormous
vegetation grows from the minutest seeds.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. Not even those things that appear to be uncertain
and without regularity—I mean rains and clouds
and the bolts of lightning darting from the clouds,
and fires poured from the cleft summits of mountains,
and the quakings of the tottering ground, and such
other disturbances of the earth about us—are without
a rational explanation, unforeseen though they
be. These things, too, have their causes, not less
those which, when they appear in unexpected places,
are regarded as prodigies, such as warm springs among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>the billows or new insular lands rising up in the vast
expanse of the sea.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. Moreover, if one has observed the beach laid
bare by the waves of the retiring sea and covered
again within a brief space of time, does he believe
that the waves have been contracted and drawn inward
by a kind of blind restlessness, to burst forth
again to seek with a mighty onset their accustomed
seats, especially since the waters increase at regular
intervals and move according to a fixed day and hour
just as the lunar star attracts them more or less,
under whose influence the ocean regulates its ebb and
flow? However, these questions had better be reserved
for their proper place, since you do not deny
the existence of a providence, but only bring complaints
against it.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. I wish to reconcile you with the gods since
they regard the best men with the most favor. For
in the nature of things, what is good can never harm
the good. Between good men and the gods a friendship
exists, virtue being the bond of amity. Friendship,
do I say? nay, more; it is a near relationship
and likeness, since the good man differs from God
only in time; he is His pupil and imitator, His true
offspring, whom his august father, no lenient trainer
in the virtues, brings up somewhat rigorously after
the manner of stern parents.</p>

<p class='c007'>6. Accordingly, when you see good men, the
favorites of the gods, toiling, sweating, ascending by
hard paths, and the bad living in licentious indulgence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>and growing effeminate in luxury, consider
that we too are gratified with the sobriety of our sons,
but with the wantonness of our household slaves;
that the former gain greater self-control by the
sterner discipline, the latter are confirmed in their
presumption. The same thing is true in regard to
God; He does not support the good man in enervating
ease; He tries him, hardens him, prepares him for
Himself.</p>
<h3 class='c013'>II.</h3>
<p class='c006'>“Why do the good meet with so many adversities?”
(you ask). No evil thing can befall a good man;
things in their nature contradictory may not be commingled.
Just as so many rivers, so much water
falling from the clouds above, so great a number
of springs impregnated with mineral substances,
do not change the saltness of the sea, do not even
dilute it; so the assaults of adversity produce no
change in the spirit of a brave man. He remains
steadfast, and whatever betides he gains for his colors,
for he is stronger than all external circumstances. I
do not, it is true, say, that he is insensible to them,
but that he triumphs over them, and, moreover, remains
calm and serene in spite of obstacles. All untoward
events he regards as so much drill. Besides,
is there any man who is only an admirer of noble
deeds, that is not eager for honest toil, or ready to do
his duty with alacrity even in the face of danger? To
what industrious man is not inactivity a punishment?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>We see athletes, whose purpose is to develop their
bodily strength, matching themselves with the most
doughty antagonists, and requiring those who prepare
them for a contest to use all their strength
against their pupils; they allow themselves to be
smitten and buffeted, and if they do not find suitable
single antagonists they pit themselves against several
at the same time.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. When virtue has no antagonist it becomes enervated;
then only does it appear what its true character
is, how strong, how virile it is when patient
endurance shows what it can accomplish. You surely
know that good men must do the same thing, to the
end that they may not fear what is hard or formidable,
nor complain about fate. Whatever happens, let the
good bear it patiently and turn it to good uses. Not
what we bear but how we bear it, is the important
thing. Do you not see how differently fathers and
mothers show their love for their children? The
former want their sons to be aroused early in order
that they may betake themselves to their studies;
their vacations even they would not have them pass
in idleness, and they draw sweat and sometimes even
tears from the youths; but mothers want to fondle
them on their bosom, keep them in the shade; they
would never have them weep, never be sad, never undergo
toil.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. God has a father’s feelings toward good men
and ardently loves them, and says: “By labors, sorrows,
privations, let them be tried in order that they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>may gain real strength.” Animals that are being
fattened grow languid by their inactivity, and by the
weight of their own bodies become incapable not only
of work, but of movement. Unalloyed felicity cannot
withstand any shock, but a constant struggle against
obstacles hardens a man against injuries, and he does
not succumb to any disaster, for even if he falls, he
fights on his knees.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. Are you surprised if God, who is a most devoted
friend of the good, and who wishes them to
attain the highest degree of perfection, assigns them
a place in which they are to be disciplined? Verily,
I am not surprised that sometimes a desire seizes the
the gods to behold great men struggling against some
misfortune. To us mortals it at times affords pleasure
to see a courageous youth await with the hunting
spear, the onset of some wild beast, or if with unblanched
cheek he thrusts back the attack of a lion;
and the spectacle is agreeable in proportion to the
rank of him who exhibits it.</p>

<p class='c007'>6. These are not the sights that attract the attention
of the gods, but childish pastimes and the
pleasures of men who have no serious aims. Behold
a spectacle worthy of a god who is intensely interested
in his work; behold a pair of champions worthy
of god, a brave man pitted against adverse fortune,
especially if he himself be the challenging party.
I do not see, I say, what more agreeable sight on
earth Jupiter can look upon, if he turns his attention
thither, than to behold Cato, after his party had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>more than once defeated, standing erect, nevertheless,
amid the ruins of the republic.</p>

<p class='c007'>7. Said he, “Though everything has yielded to
the behests of one man; though the lands be guarded
by legions and the seas by fleets and the soldiers of
Caesar keep watch at our gates, there is a way of escape
for Cato. Single-handed will he make a broad
way for liberty; this sword, pure and untarnished
even in civil strife, shall at length perform a worthy
and noble deed; the liberty it could not give to his
country, it shall give to Cato. Perform my soul, a
deed long meditated, free thyself from earthly concerns!</p>

<p class='c007'>8. Already Petreius and Juba have turned their
swords against each other and lie dead, slain with
mutual hands. A brave and glorious covenant to
die was that, but one that was unworthy of my
greatness; it is as ignoble for Cato to beg for
death at the hands of another as (to beg for) life.” I
am sure the gods looked with keen satisfaction when
that hero, the intrepid liberator of himself, takes
counsel for the safety of others and provides a way of
escape for the fugitives; when he pursues his studies
far even into that final night; when he thrusts the
sword into his own sacred breast; when he disembowels
himself and sets free with his own hand that
purest spirit unworthy to be contaminated with a
sword.</p>

<p class='c007'>9. Hence I would fain believe that the thrust was
badly directed and the wound not fatal; it was not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>enough for the immortal gods to have beheld Cato
once only; his courage was restrained and called back
that it might show itself in a more difficult part.
For death may be said not so much to have come
upon so great a soul as to have been sought by it.
Why should they not rejoice to see their favorite
pass from life in a way so glorious and memorable?
Death deifies those whose departure fills with admiration
even those who stand aghast at the manner of it.</p>
<h3 class='c013'>III.</h3>
<p class='c006'>But as I proceed with my discourse, I shall show
that not all those things which seem to be evils are
such. For the present, I affirm that the conditions
you call hard, adverse, and terrible, are in the first
place best for those very persons whom they befall;
and in the second, for all men, since the gods are
more concerned for mankind as a whole than for the
individual; and lastly; that they happen either with
their approval, or to men who are worthy of them, if
without their approval. To these propositions I shall
add that such things take place in the fixed order of
the world and rightly happen to the good, in virtue
of the same law which makes them good. From this
point of view I shall then convince you that you
never need feel pity for the good man; for though he
may be called unfortunate, he never is so.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. The most difficult of the affirmations I have
made seems to be the first, to wit, that it is for our
own good these very things happen which we dread
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>and shudder at. Is it good for anybody, you say, to
be driven into exile, to see his children reduced to
want, to bear a wife to the grave, to be disgraced,
maimed? If you are surprised that this should result
in good to any one, then you will be surprised
that persons are sometimes cured by cutting and
burning not the less than by hunger and thirst. But
if you will reflect that as remedial measures, the
bones have to be laid bare or taken out, veins to be
extracted, and even members to be amputated, because
they cannot be allowed to remain attached
to it without detriment to the whole body; you
will also admit that some unpleasant things are an
advantage to those whom they befall, no less than that
some things which are accounted good and are sought
after, are an injury to those who find pleasure in
them, such as eating and drinking to excess and
other things that kill by the gratification they afford.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. Among the many noteworthy sayings of our
friend Demetrius there is one that is fresh in my
mind and keeps sounding and ringing in my ears.
“There is no being,” says he, “more unfortunate than
the man who never felt adversity.” For he has never
had an opportunity to test himself. Though everything
may have come to him when he wished it or
even before he wished it, the gods have nevertheless
not thought well of him. They have adjudged him
unworthy of a struggle with adversity lest he be overcome
by it, for it avoids all cowards as if saying,
Why should I choose such an antagonist? he lays
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>down his arms forthwith; there is no need of all my
strength against him; he is beaten by a feeble onset;
he cannot bear even a look.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. Let another be selected for the struggle. It is
a shame to fight with a man who wants to be beaten.
A gladiator regards it as a disgrace to be pitted
against an inferior antagonist for he knows there is
no glory in overcoming one who is vanquished without
danger. Adversity does likewise; it seeks out
foemen worthy of their antagonist and passes by
some with disdain. It always attacks the doughtiest
and boldest for a trial of its strength.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. It tries Mucius with fire, Fabricius with poverty,
Regulus with torture, Socrates with poison, Cato
with death. It is misfortune alone that finds noble
examples. Is Mucius to be commiserated because he
put his hand into an enemy’s fire and punished himself
for his mistake? because he vanquished with a
burned hand a king whom he could not vanquish
with it armed? Would he have been happier if he
had warmed it in the bosom of a mistress?</p>

<p class='c007'>6. Is Fabricius to be pitied because he tilled his
own field when not engaged in public duties? because
he waged war against riches as well as against
Pyrrhus? because he ate, by his own fireside, the
same roots and herbs that his triumphant old age
pulled up on his farm? Can we say that he would
have been happier if he had filled his stomach with
fish from a far off strand and with exotic birds? or if
he had stimulated his jaded and nauseated stomach
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>with oysters from the Upper and the Lower sea? or if
he had encircled with a huge pile of different fruits,
the finest game captured at the cost of many a huntsman’s
life?</p>

<p class='c007'>7. Is Rutilius unfortunate because those who condemned
him decided a case against themselves for all
time to come? because he was more willing to be deprived
of his country than to be recalled from exile?
because he alone dared to deny anything to the
dictator Sulla, and when invited to return, not only
refused, but fled farther? “Let those manage affairs,”
said he, “whom thy good fortune keeps in Rome! Let
them look upon the pool of blood in the Forum and
the heads of senators floating on the Servilian lake,—for
that was the field of carnage of those proscribed
by Sulla—and the bands of assassins roaming through
the city, and the many thousands of Roman citizens
slain in one place after pledges of immunity had
been given, yes, because of those very pledges! Let
those look upon these things who are not able to endure
exile.”</p>

<p class='c007'>8. Shall we say that Sulla is to be congratulated
because, when he descends to the Forum, a way is
opened for him with the sword? because he allows
the heads of men of consular rank to be shown him
in public, and paid the price of their slaughter by the
hand of the quaestor and from the fisc? And he
who did these things is the same man that enacted
the Cornelian law! Let us return to Regulus. What
injury did his destiny do him by making him, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>well-known exemplar of good faith, an exemplar of
patient endurance? Nails pierce his skin, and whatever
way he lays down his weary body he lies on a
wound, while his open eyes doom him to perpetual
wakefulness.</p>

<p class='c007'>9. The greater the anguish, the greater will be the
glory. Wouldst thou know how little he regretted
the high value he set on fortitude? Heal his wounds
and send him back to the senate—he will give the
same advice (as before). Dost thou think Maecenas
happier when a prey to the torments of love and when
grieving over the daily repulses of a wayward wife,
he courts sleep amid the sound of symphonies softly
sounding in the distance? Though he stupify himself
with wine, and seek diversion in the murmur of
waters, or trick his troubled mind with a thousand
pastimes, he lies awake on his bed of down no less
than the other on his bed of torture. But for the
former there is the solace that he is enduring hardness
for a noble purpose, and he can look away from
his pain to its cause; the latter, surfeited with pleasures,
weighed down by an excess of good fortune, is
more tormented by the cause of his sufferings than
by the sufferings themselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>10. Not yet has vice so completely taken possession
of the human race as to make it doubtful that
the majority, if they had the choice of their lot,
would prefer that of Regulus to that of Maecenas.
Or, if there should be anybody who had presumption
enough to say that he had rather be born a Maecenas
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>than a Regulus, the same person, even though he
might not openly admit it, would also rather be born
a Terentia. Do you pronounce Socrates unfortunate
because he drained the executioner’s cup as if it had
been the draught of immortality, and discoursed about
death up to the moment it overtook him? Was his
lot an unhappy one because his blood congealed and
his vital force stopped by the gradually advancing
rigor of death?</p>

<p class='c007'>11. How much more is he to be envied than those
who are served from goblets studded with gems, for
whom a male prostitute, accustomed to submit to
every kind of abuse, whose virility is gone or at least
doubtful, dissolves the snow that floats in a golden
chalice? Whatever they drink they vomit up, to
their chagrin, and taste again mixed with bile; but he
willingly and with joy drains the poisonous draught.
For Cato it is sufficient that the unanimous verdict of
mankind has raised him to the pinnacle of felicity;
him destiny selected as one who was fitted to contend
against everything that is to be dreaded.</p>

<p class='c007'>12. Is the enmity of the powers that be a serious
matter? let him be opposed at the same time by
Pompey, Caesar, Crassus. Is it hard to bear when
one is less honored than worse men? let him be sacrificed
for Vatinius. Is it a hard thing to be involved
in civil wars? throughout the whole world let him
fight for the good cause, equally renowned for his
misfortunes as for his bravery. Is it hard to take
one’s own life? let him do it. What do I wish to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>prove by these things? I would have all men know
that those vicissitudes of which Cato was deemed
worthy, cannot be regarded as evils.</p>
<h3 class='c013'>IV.</h3>
<p class='c006'>Prosperity comes to ordinary people and to men of
mean abilities, but it is the prerogative of a great
man to overcome the calamities and terrors that
frighten mortals. In truth, to be always happy and
to pass one’s life without mental anxiety, is to be
ignorant of half of man’s destiny. Thou art a great
man; yet how am I to know it unless fate gives thee
an opportunity to show thy worth?</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Thou didst enter the Olympian games as a contestant;
if there was none beside thyself, thou hast
the crown, thou hast not the victory. I congratulate
thee, not as a brave man, but as one who has gained
the consulship or the praetorship: thou hast won
political honors. I can say the same thing to a good
man, unless some more than ordinary emergency has
given him an opportunity to show his strength of
soul.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. Unhappy do I adjudge thee, if thou hast never
been unhappy; thou hast passed thy life without an
adversary. No one knows what thou mightest have
done; thou dost not even know it thyself. We need
to be tried that we may find out what we are; what a
man can do can be ascertained only by trial. For
this reason men have sometimes voluntarily encountered
obstacles that seemed to evade them and sought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>an opportunity for demonstrating to others the virtue
that was passing into oblivion.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. I assert that great men sometimes rejoice in
tribulation like valiant soldiers in battles. I heard
Triumphus, a gladiator under Caius Caesar (Caligula)
complain because he had so little to do. “How my
best days are speeding away,” said he! Courage is
eager for danger and looks to the end in view, not at
what it is likely to encounter, for the reason that what
it encounters is part of the glory. Warriors are
proud of their wounds; joyfully they point to the blood
it was their good fortune to shed. Those who return
from the combat unscathed may have been just
as brave—it is the wounded man that is the observed
of all eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>God shows his good will to those whom he would
have attain the highest excellence every time he gives
them an opportunity to display courage and endurance;
this is possible only in some contingency beset with
difficulties. You form your opinion of a pilot in a
storm; of a soldier, in battle. By what test am I
to know how thou wilt bear up against poverty, if
thou aboundest in wealth? By what test am I to
know how thou wilt bear up under ignominy and
disgrace and popular hatred, if thou growest old
amid public applause? if a strong and unswerving
popular partiality supports thee in all thou doest?</p>

<p class='c007'>6. How am I to know with what equanimity thou
wilt bear the loss of children, if thou seest about
thee all those thou hast begotten? I have listened
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>to thee when thou wert offering consolation to others;
then should I have seen thee when thou wert thyself
in need of consolation; when thou wert trying to
restrain thyself from sorrowing. Do not, I beseech
thee, shrink from these things which the immortal
gods send upon thee as stimuli to thy courage. A
disaster is an occasion of virtue. Those persons one
can rightly call wretched who grow effeminate in
superabounding prosperity; whom a dead calm bears
along, as it were, in a motionless sea.</p>

<p class='c007'>7. No matter what befalls them, they are unprepared
for it. Hardships bear heaviest on those who
have never known them; heavy lies the yoke on the
neck that has not felt it. The mere thought of a
wound makes the raw recruit turn pale; the veteran
looks without blanching upon his own blood because
he knows that he has often gained a victory at the
price of it. Then it is that God trains and hardens
those whom he has chosen, whom he loves and
wishes well to; but those whom he seems to treat
with indulgence, whom he spares, he keeps tender
for the evils to come. For you are mistaken if you
conclude that any one is exempt; he who has long
basked in the sunshine of fortune will have his
turn.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every one that thinks he is discharged has been
placed among the reserves. (You ask) why does
God afflict every good man with ill health or sorrow
or other misfortune? Because in camp-life the
most perilous duties are also laid on the bravest; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>commander sends picked men to fall upon the enemy
from a nocturnal ambuscade, or to explore a route,
or to carry by assault an outpost. No one of those
who go forth says, “The general has a poor opinion
of me,” but, “He has judged wisely and well,” And
so let all say who are ordered to undergo what to the
coward and the slothful seem to be painful experiences:
God has accounted us worthy to be used as
examples by which to show how much human
nature can endure. Flee from pleasure, from that
unmanly felicity in which the active powers of
the mind grow torpid, unless something intervenes
to recall man’s lot, by a sort of perpetual intoxication.</p>

<p class='c007'>9. Him whom glass windows protect against every
breath of air; whose feet are kept warm by fomentations
periodically renewed; whose dining-rooms are
made always comfortable by heat within the walls and
under the floor—such a person, not even a gentle
breeze passes over without danger. Though everything
that transcends the bounds of moderation is
hurtful, the most perilous intemperance is that of
good fortune. It excites the brain, awakens idle
fancies in the mind, puts dense darkness between the
false and the true.</p>

<p class='c007'>10. Which is better, to bear up under continuous
misfortune that incites us to do our best, or to be
crushed under unbounded and inexhaustible riches?
Death comes gently when the stomach is empty; it
is from repletion that men die like beasts. Accordingly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>the gods follow the same method with good
men that teachers follow with good pupils—they require
the hardest labor from those of whom they
cherish the highest hopes. Dost thou believe that it
is out of hatred for their children that the Lacedaemonians
try, by public scourgings, what stuff they
are made of? Their own fathers exhort them to bear
bravely their flagellations, and ask them, when bleeding
and half dead, to proffer unflinchingly their
wounds for fresh wounds.</p>

<p class='c007'>11. Why is it strange if God sends severe trials
upon noble spirits? a test of one’s courage is never
an easy matter. Is it destiny that scourges and
lacerates us? let us endure it; ’tis not wanton cruelty,
it is a contest; the oftener we enter it, the
stronger we shall become. The solidest part of the
body, frequent use has made so. We must be subjected
to the buffetings of fortune in order that in
this way we may become callous to it. Little by
little, fortune makes us a match for itself; contempt
of dangers results from often braving them. In this
way sailors inure their bodies to the sea; the hands
of the husbandman are calloused; the arms of the
soldier are strong from hurling javelins; the limbs of
runners are agile. That part of everybody is the
strongest that has exercised the most.</p>

<p class='c007'>12. The soul acquires the strength to brave misfortune
by patient endurance; what it can effect in
us thou mayst know, if thou dost but consider what
hardship does for those peoples that go about without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>clothing and are strong by their very indigence.
Consider all the nations over whom the sway of Rome
does not extend, I mean the Germans and every
nomad tribe along the Danube. Perpetual winter,
a severe climate, bear hard upon them, a sterile soil
grudgingly supports them, a hut or branches of trees
protect them against the rain, they roam over marshes
hardened by frost, for food they capture wild beasts.</p>

<p class='c007'>13. Dost thou think them wretched? No one is
wretched when he performs what habit has made
second nature to him; for by degrees we find pleasure
in doing what we began to do from necessity. These
peoples have no houses and no resting place except
as weariness finds them from day to day; their food
is cheap and obtained only as wanted; their naked
bodies are exposed to the terrible extremes of a
horrid climate; what thou regardest as a frightful
calamity is the whole life of many peoples.</p>

<p class='c007'>14. Why dost thou wonder that good men are
called upon to undergo violent shocks to the end that
they may stand the more firmly? A tree does not
take deep root, or grow strong, unless it is frequently
shaken by the wind; for as a result of violent agitation
its fiber is toughened and its roots more firmly
set. Those are fragile that grow up in sheltered valleys.
It is therefore a boon to good men, as it makes
them fearless amid danger, to become familiar with
hardships and to bear with equanimity those things
that are not ills, except when they are borne with an
ill grace.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>
  <h3 class='c013'>V.</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>Add, now, that it is best for all that every good man
should, so to speak, be always under arms and in action.
It is the purpose of God, just as if He were a
wise man, to demonstrate that those things which the
average man longs for, which he fears, are neither
good nor evil; but it will be evident that those things
are good that are sent upon good men, and those evil,
that fall upon the bad. Blindness would be dreadful,
if nobody had lost his sight except those who deserved
to have their eyes put out. Accordingly, let Appius
and Metellus be deprived of eyesight. Riches are
not a good.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. And so even the procurer Elius is rich in order
that money to which men have given a sacred character
in temples may also be found in a brothel. In no
way is God better able to expose to contempt those
things that men covet than by bestowing them
upon the vilest and taking them from the worthiest.
“But,” sayst thou, “it is unjust that a good man
should suffer mutilation, or be crucified, or be bound
in fetters, while the bad strut proudly at large and
live in luxury.”</p>

<p class='c007'>3. What then? is it not also unjust when brave
men are required to take up arms, to pass the night
in camps and to defend the outposts, though the
bandages are still on their wounds, while in the city,
eunuchs and debauchees by profession go about in
security. What further? is it not unjust that the
noblest virgins should be aroused at night to perform
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>their sacred duties while impure women are enjoying
sound sleep? Toil claims the best men. The senate
is often in session during the entire day, when at the
same time all the vilest men are either taking their
ease in the Campus Martius, or loitering in eating-houses,
or wasting their time in idle gossip. It is
just so in the world at large—good men toil, sacrifice
themselves or are sacrificed, and willingly at that.
They are not dragged along by destiny, they follow it
and keep pace with it; had they known whither it
would lead them, they would have preceded it.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. I remember also to have heard these encouraging
words from that noblest of men, Demetrius. “This
one complaint,” said he, “I have to make against you,
ye immortal gods: it is that ye did not sooner make
known to me your will; for of my own accord I would
have come to those things to which I am now summoned.
Do you wish to take away my children?
For you I have brought them up. Do you wish any
portion of my body? Take it. No great thing it is
that I am offering you; soon I shall resign it entirely
to you. Do you wish my life? Why not? I shall not
be slow to give back to you what ye have entrusted
to my keeping; ye shall find me willing to give up
anything ye ask. Still I should rather have proferred
it to you than given it up. What need was there to
take what you could have had as a gift. Yet not
even now do ye need to constrain me, since that is
not taken from a man which he does not try to retain.
I am in no sense the victim of constraint or violence,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>nor am I God’s slave, but I am in accord with Him,
and this all the more cheerfully because I know that
everything takes its course in accordance with an
immutable law established from all eternity.”</p>

<p class='c007'>5. The fates lead us, and our lot is assigned to us
from the very hour of our birth. Cause depends upon
cause; an unbroken chain of events links together
public and private affairs. We ought therefore to
bear with fortitude whatever befalls us because everything
takes place, not as we think, by chance, but in
its due order. A long time in advance, all our pleasures
and our pains have been determined, and although
in the great diversity of individual lives, one
life may seem to stand apart, it all comes to this:
transitory beings ourselves we have entered into a
transitory inheritance.</p>

<p class='c007'>6. Why then does this disquiet us? Why indulge
in complaints? it is the law of our existence.
Let nature use our bodies, which are its own, as it
wishes; let us cheerfully and bravely meet whatever
comes, bearing in mind that what we lose is not our
property. What is the duty of a good man? To resign
himself to his destiny. It is a great consolation
to share the fate of the universe. Whatever it
be that decrees how we are to live, how to die, it
binds even the gods by the same inexorable law; an
irresistible current bears along terrestrial and celestial
things.</p>

<p class='c007'>The creator and governor of the universe has indeed
prescribed the course of events, but He Himself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>follows them; He obeys always, He commanded but
once.</p>

<p class='c007'>7. “But why was God so unjust in the destinies he
prescribed for mortals, as to send upon good men
poverty, wounds, and cruel deaths”? The artisan
cannot change matter; it is passive. There are some
things that cannot be separated from others; they
are bound together and indivisible. Sluggish natures
and such as are prone to sink into slumber or
into a state closely akin to slumber, are conjoined of
inert elements; to form a man who is really worthy
of the name a more heroic destiny is needed. His
path will not be smooth; he must go up-hill and
down-hill, be tossed on the waves, and guide his
bark through turbid waters; in spite of changing fortune,
he must hold on his way.</p>

<p class='c007'>8. He will meet many obstacles hard to remove or
surmount, but he will himself remove them and
smooth his path. Gold is tried by fire; brave men
by misfortune. Behold to what heights virtue may
climb; thou shouldst know that it cannot go by ways
that are free from dangers.</p>

      <div class='line'>Hard is the way at first: though drawn by prancing steeds,</div>
      <div class='line'>Slow, up the sky, the shining car proceeds;—</div>
      <div class='line'>On land and sea I gaze from heaven’s high crest;</div>
      <div class='line'>Fear and emotion fill my heaving breast.</div>
      <div class='line'>Steep is the downward way, and with tight rein</div>

<p class='c009'>9. When the high-spirited youth heard these words
he said, “I like the way; I shall ascend it even though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>I fall forthwith in so doing.” The sun-god still tries
to dissuade him from his rash purpose by exciting
his fears:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Hold straight thy course nor turn for aught aside,</div>

      <div class='line'>And Haemon’s bow and Leo’s searching face.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>To this he replied, “Yoke the steeds to the chariot;
by the very words which you seek to deter me, you incite
me. I long to stand where Sol himself quakes
with fear; it is only ignoble and weak souls that journey
on safe roads; courage ventures on giddy
heights.”</p>
<h3 class='c013'>VI.</h3>
<p class='c006'>“But why does God suffer any evil to befall the
good”? Verily, He does not suffer it. He wards off
from them all evils, crimes and misdeeds and impure
thoughts and avaricious designs and unbridled
passions and lust after other men’s property; He
watches over and protects them. Will any one in addition
to this demand of God that He shall also bear
the luggage of good men (as if He were a slave)!
They themselves cast this burden upon God; mere
externals they make light of. Democritus threw
away his riches, thinking them a fardel upon his noble
soul. Why do you wonder that God sometimes
suffers that to come upon a good man which he himself
desires?</p>

<p class='c007'>2. “Good men sometimes lose their children.”
Why not, when they sometimes even put them to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>death? “They are sent into exile.” Why not, when
they sometimes leave their country, voluntarily, never
to return? “They are put to death.” Why not, when
they sometimes lay violent hands on themselves?
“Why do they suffer many hardships?” That they
may teach others to suffer patiently; they are born to
be examples.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. Think of God as speaking to them thus: “What
right have ye to complain of me, ye who take pleasure
in doing right? Other men I have encompassed
with seductive pleasures and their torpid souls I have
lulled into a long and delusive sleep; gold, silver and
ivory I have lavished upon them; yet at heart they are
good for nothing. Those men whom you look upon
as fortunate, if you regard them, not with respect to
what is external but what is concealed, are wretched,
unclean, deformed, adorned on the outside after
the similitude of their own walls. Their good fortune
is not substantial and unalloyed; it is a mere
crust and a thin one at that.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. Accordingly, as long as they are allowed to
stand and to show themselves as they wish to appear,
they make a brilliant and imposing display; but when
something occurs that disarranges their plans and
discloses their true character, then it becomes apparent
how real and deep their foulness. To you I have given
a genuine, an abiding good; the more one turns it
about and looks at it from every side, the greater and
better it appears. I have given you the strength to
contemn what other men fear; to make of little account
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>what others long for. You do not shine because
of externals; it is the kingdom within you that
is your highest good. Thus does the world disdain
what is on the outside because happy in the contemplation
of itself; within you have I placed all real
good; not to need happiness is your happiness.”</p>

<p class='c007'>5. “But many sad occurrences take place, things
from which we shrink in terror, and which are hard
to bear.” “Because I am not able to ward them off
from you, I have armed you against all changes of
fortune. Endure bravely; in this you may surpass
God: He is exempt from suffering, you are superior to
it. Contemn poverty; no one lives so poor as he is
born. Contemn pain; either it will end or you. Contemn
fortune; I have given to it no weapon with
which to wound the soul. Contemn death; it either
ends your existence or transfers it.</p>

<p class='c007'>6. Before all things, I took care that no one should
keep you here against your will; the way for your
departure is open. If you do not want to fight, you
can run away. Therefore, with all the restrictions I
have placed upon you, I have made nothing easier
for you than death. Only look and you will see how
short and easy is the way to liberty. I have made
the way shorter for those who wish to go out of the
world than for those who are entering it; besides, destiny
would have had great power over you, if it were
as hard for a man to die as to be born.</p>

<p class='c007'>7. Every moment of time, every place, can teach
you how easy it is to quit nature’s service and to return
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>to her her gift. At the very foot of the altar and
amid the solemnities of those who are offering sacrifices
for the preservation of life, learn to know death.
The huge bodies of bulls drop from the effects of a
little wound, and beasts of enormous strength are
felled by a blow from a human hand; with a little
piece of iron the jointures of the vertabrae are
severed, and when the ligature that binds the head
and neck is cut asunder, the huge mass falls dead to
the ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>8. The breath does not lurk in some secret hiding
place, nor must it necessarily be sought out with
the sword; there is no need of piercing the vitals
with a deep wound; death is close at hand. I have
not designated any particular place for the fatal
thrust, it may enter anywhere. What is called death,
that time in which the spirit leaves the body, is so
brief that its fleetness cannot be perceived. Whether
it be a noose that strangles you, or water that suffocates
you, or a fall upon the hard earth that dashes
the life out of you, or fire drawn in with the breath
that cuts off its return—whatever it be, its effect is
speedy. Are you not ashamed to fear so long what
may be done so quickly?”</p>

NOTES.</p>
<p class='c006'>A few notes have been added to the translation.
They bear chiefly on obscure allusions in Seneca’s
treatise, as the necessary biographical data may be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>found in almost any encyclopedia. The notes are
placed by themselves so as not to interrupt the
reader, who may omit them, if he chooses.</p>
<p class='c015'>I.</p>
<p class='c015'>2. It was held by some of the Greek philosophers, notably
Epicurus, that the universe was built up by a fortuitous
concourse of atoms.</p>

<p class='c003'>4. Some texts have <i>quaeris</i>, you are seeking information.</p>

<p class='c003'>6. <i>Vernae</i> were slaves born in the household of their masters,
sometimes his own children by a female slave. The
<i>licentia vernularum</i> was proverbial in Rome. The <i>vernae</i> and
<i>vernulae</i> were allowed privileges not accorded to slaves obtained
by purchase.</p>
<p class='c015'>II.</p>
<p class='c015'><i>In suum colorem</i>, to its colors. The parties represented in
the race-course were distinguished by different colors. The
significance of the expression is therefore evident. Another
less probable explanation of the passage is that the author
has reference to the effect of red wine when mixed with liquids
of another color.</p>

<p class='c003'>3. As the holidays in Rome were very numerous much
time was lost by those who spent all of them in idleness.</p>

<p class='c003'>7. Cato, surnamed Uticensis, is here meant. He was the
patron saint of the Roman Stoics.</p>

<p class='c003'>9. The sentence here translated, “For death,” etc., may
also mean, “For it requires less courage to meet death (once)
than to seek it a second time.”</p>
<p class='c015'>III.</p>
<p class='c015'>6. The wild boar roasted whole was generally placed on the
center of the table. Around it were piled fruits, vegetables,
etc.</p>

<p class='c003'>7. <i>Tua felicitas.</i> Sulla called himself <span class='sc'>Felix</span>, and in the
next section we find this epithet applied to him. The atrocities
he committed are familiar to every reader of Roman history.</p>

<p class='c003'>8. The Cornelian law. The Roman Legal Code was greatly
modified under the inspiration of Sulla. The statute here referred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>to, fixed the penalty for homicide and similar crimes.
It bore its author’s gentile name.</p>

<p class='c003'>The familiar story of Regulus was accepted as true by
the Romans, and, in fact, by the world generally, until recent
times. It is interesting as showing the high estimate placed
upon patriotism by the Romans from their point of view.
Though narrow it was intense and played a conspicuous part
in the growth of the Roman state.</p>

<p class='c003'>9. Maecenas the well-known Premier of the emperor Augustus
was passionately attached to his wife Terentia; but her
fidelity was more than suspected, a condition of things that led
to many quarrels with her husband.</p>

<p class='c003'>11. The writer refers here to the disgusting practice of the
Romans, who, at their feasts, frequently ate and drank to
excess, then produced vomiting in order to be able to begin
eating and drinking over again.</p>

<p class='c003'>12. Vatinius was a worthless fellow who defeated Cato in
the contest for the praetorship.</p>
<p class='c015'>IV.</p>
<p class='c015'>12. The Romans were wilfully blind as to the climate and
soil of Germany. It was a case of “sour grapes.” After vainly
endeavoring to conquer its inhabitants, they decided that they
were not worth the trouble of conquest.</p>
<p class='c015'>V.</p>
<p class='c015'>6. “Whatever it be” etc. The First Cause, about which
Seneca is in some doubt, whether it is personal or impersonal,
material or immaterial; whether matter exists of necessity or
is created. In 4 he uses <i>mundus</i> in a personal sense. He is
also inconsistent in his attitude toward suicide; for after assuring
us in the strongest language, that it is every man’s duty
to endure whatever Providence or Fate or Destiny or Chance
sends upon him, he ends by telling him that if the service is
too hard he is at perfect liberty to run away from it. Gréard
rightly says, “He confuses God with the world, Providence
with destiny; he admits and does not admit the immortality
of the soul; he proclaims the freedom of the will, and denies it.”</p>

<p class='c003'>8. 9. Dr. Lodge, (1614) translates the two extracts from

  <h2 id='chap6' class='c005'>PLUTARCH AND THE GREECE OF HIS AGE.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>Ever since I have known enough about Greek
literature to form an opinion of my own on its merits,
it has been a matter of surprise to me that the authors
who flourished in the century or two immediately
preceding and succeeding the Christian era, are
treated with so much neglect. The histories of
Greek literature, whose name is legion, frequently
end with Grecian independence; or if they continue
the subject some centuries longer, treat the later
periods in a half-hearted and perfunctory manner, as
if they were deserving of nothing better. While it is
true, that in some departments the field is relatively
infertile, there are many writers well worth a careful
study, and several eminently so. The storm and
stress period is over; the centuries of vigorous productions
well-nigh past; yet the Greek mind is not
dead; the field of authorship still bears many fine
ears and occasionally a large sheaf for the careful
gleaner. The times that could produce a Polybius, a
Plutarch, an Epictetus, an Arrian, a Dion Chrysostomus,
a Lucian, to say nothing of Josephus and
Philo, together with others, a score or more in number,
cannot justly be charged with intellectual stagnation.
If the form in which the later writers express
their thoughts has no longer the elegance, nor
the thoughts themselves the profundity, of their predecessors,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span> they are far from being unworthy of painstaking
study. If men reflected less, they did more,
or were at least active in a larger sphere. Greeks
were now to be found in all parts of the civilized
world; they still provided its intellectual nourishment;
Athens was still its university and it is of the
Greeks of these centuries more than of the earlier
that Horace could say,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Graeca capta ferum victorem cepit et artes</div>
      <div class='line'>Intulit agresti Latio.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Greek culture had become so widespread that a
sojourn in Athens was no longer necessary for those
who were ambitious to learn the language in its
purest form. Though this city was still looked upon
with a certain filial regard, half a score of rivals had
sprung up in three continents that at times seriously
threatened its prestige. The centuries that meet at
the birth of Christ are the link that unites the golden
age of Greek literature with the Renaissance. In
them was coined much of the small change of Greek
thought, which was by reason of its form the more
widely circulated. That much of it was silver, so to
speak, only made it the more generally available.</p>

<p class='c007'>But while the writings of these three or four centuries
have suffered greatly from neglect at the hands
of the moderns, the language in its narrower sense,
except that of the New Testament, has been almost
wholly ignored. It needs but a brief examination of
the current Greek dictionaries to convince the student
that here is an ample field for profitable work.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>Even the great Thesaurus of Stephanus often leaves
one sadly in the lurch; besides, it is both too extensive
and too expensive for general use. What we
need is a careful lexicographical and grammatical
study of the individual authors and the presentation
of the results in as succinct a form as possible.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is a pleasure to note the signs of a revival in this
quarter—for that it is not a misnomer to speak of a
revival will be evident to those who know that the
reader of some of the authors above named, together
with others, is largely compelled to rely on texts that
are more than half a century old, in some cases much
more. In this laudable work of rediscovery, Professor
Mahaffy in Great Britain, and Professor Krumbacher
in Germany, may be regarded as the leaders. The
former, by his various works upon the Greeks under
Roman sway, and the latter by his masterly <i>Geschichte
der Byzantinischen Litteratur</i> and his <i>Byzantinische
Zeitschrift</i> have done more than any two writers in
the present century to awaken an interest in a subject
that has long been in a comatose condition. The
present volume, though bearing upon the general
theme, is concerned with but a small portion of it. I
have tried to throw a little light upon two authors, in
whose writings are many passages that put them in
some sort of relation to nascent Christianity. While
it is almost absolutely certain that neither Seneca
nor Plutarch had any knowledge of the new doctrines
first preached in their time, it ought surely to be a
matter of interest to every thinking man to note how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>closely the best that is in the old philosophy approached
the new religion; or, to state the case somewhat
differently, that the old philosophy and the new
religion are in many points identical.</p>

<p class='c007'>The French have, almost from the beginning of
their national literature, been ardent admirers of
Plutarch. Amyot reduced some of his precepts to
rhyme in order that they might the more readily be
taught to children, and regarded his writings as more
profitable than any other except the Scriptures.
Gui-Patin makes Pliny, Aristotle, Plutarch, and
Seneca constitute an entire family,—father, mother,
older and younger brother—and thus in a sense
represent the whole circle of literature. Rollin copies
his Parallel Lives almost literally into his Ancient
History. Rousseau cites him among the few authors
that he read in his old age. He is the last consolation
of St. Pierre. Laharpe regards him as by nature
the most moral man that ever lived; and Joubert
calls him the Herodotus of Philosophy, and deems
his Lives the wisdom of antiquity in its entirety.
Montaigne says, “I never settled myself to the reading
of any authors but Plutarch and Seneca.” Again,
“Plutarch had rather we should applaud his judgment
than commend his knowledge, and had rather
leave us with an appetite to read more, than glutted
with that we have already read. He knew very well
that a man may say too much even upon the best
subjects, and that Alexandrides did justly reproach
him who made very elegant but too long speeches to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>the Ephori, when he said: ‘O stranger, thou speakest
the things thou oughtest to speak, but not after the
manner thou shouldst speak them.’” Elsewhere he
recurs to the subject with these words, “As to what
concerns my other reading that mixes a little more
profit with the pleasure and whence I learn how to
marshal my opinions, the books that serve me to this
purpose are Plutarch and Seneca. Both of them
have this great convenience suited to my humor, that
the knowledge I there seek is discoursed in some
pieces that do not require any great trouble of reading
long, of which I am incapable.” In his Essays,
Montaigne refers to or quotes Plutarch more than
two hundred times, and Seneca almost as often. So
far as Plutarch’s Lives are concerned, the translation
published by Jacques Amyot, bishop of Auxerre,
in 1559, is still regarded as a masterpiece. This version
is of special interest to English-speaking people,
because from it Sir Thomas North made his translation,
published some twenty years later, and Shakespeare,
in turn, took the material for his plays dealing
with antique life. Of later English translations, that
of the Langhorne is undoubtedly the most popular,
though the one known as Dryden’s, albeit he had
little to do with it, as revised by A. H. Clough, is
much read. That of Stewart and Long is not generally
known. There seems to be no English translation
of Plutarch’s Moral Writings except that made
by a number of Oxford scholars some two centuries
since and edited by Professor Goodwin. The German
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>version made by Kaltwasser just one hundred
years ago, is an excellent piece of work. The Lives
have been frequently translated.</p>

<p class='c007'>About sixty miles northwest of the city of Athens
near the road leading from Delphi to Lebadeia, midway
between the gulf of Corinth and the northern
end of the Euripus, lies to-day the town of Chaeroneia,
or rather its modern representative, Capraena.
Though never a municipality of much importance, its
inhabitants, before the time of Plutarch, had been the
spectators of many stirring events. Epaminondas
called the plain near it the dancing-plot of Ares, an
epithet that was abundantly justified by preceding
and succeeding occurrences. Lying in a measure
between northern and southern Greece it was rich in
historical reminiscences and in traditions. Already
known to Homer as Arne, it subsequently witnessed
the countless hosts of Dareius and Xerxes pass beneath
its walls. Near it Philip of Macedon completely
overthrew the allied Thebans and Athenians,
<span class='fss'>B. C.</span> 338. In Plutarch’s time the mound erected in
honor of the king’s soldiers who lost their lives here,
was still in a fair state of preservation, and the oak
under which Alexander had erected his tent was yet
standing. In 279 the Gauls passed over the plain of
Chaeroneia leaving desolation in their track. Twenty-eight
years later the Boeotians were defeated near
the town in a battle with the Aetolians. Still later,
by a century and a half, Sulla inflicted a crushing
blow on his enemies, for the most part Greeks, under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>the command of Archelaus, the lieutenant of Mithridates.
It was two citizens of Chaeroneia who performed
for the Roman general a service similar to
that rendered to Xerxes by Ephialtes. In order to
leave a memorial of his success he erected a trophy
on the summit of an adjacent hill. Another trophy,
dating from this time and of special significance to
the Chaeroneans, was the statue of Lucius Lucullus,
a Roman commander, that stood in their marketplace.
They had become involved in a quarrel with
their old enemies, the Orchomenians, on the charge
of having caused the death of a Roman officer and
several of his attendants; but through the interposition
of Lucullus had obtained a verdict from the
home government in their favor.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the pen is mightier than the sword. Posterity
is not greatly interested in wars and battles in which
no great principles are involved; besides, all sanguinary
conflicts are of more or less local significance.
Hence it is that Chaeroneia is chiefly known, not because
of the two hundred thousand men who lost
their lives or limbs near it, but as the birthplace and
lifelong residence of one of the best-known characters
in the literary history of the world. About half a
score of years after the crucifixion, this august yet
kindly personage, first saw the light in what was, even
for Greece, an obscure town, but which he never left
for any considerable time, until the day of his death,
at a ripe old age. The visible remains of the first
great battle fought here in historic times are the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>fragments of a colossal lion erected to commemorate,
not a victory, but the valor of those who fell fighting
for their country and for what they believed to be its
freedom. There is also a village of some fifty houses,
a church, a schoolhouse and a stone seat which its
inhabitants fondly imagine to have been the property
of their illustrious fellow townsman, and which they
eagerly show as such, to the traveler. Small as the
village is to-day, it can never have been a place of
much importance, a fact that is attested by the scant
remains of its ancient theater, one of the smallest in
Greece.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Plutarch’s time the chief industry of his native
town consisted in its trade in oil and the manufacture
of perfumes and unguents from the numerous
flowers and herbs that grew in the vicinity. In conformity
to ancient usage, this business was chiefly
carried on by slaves, while its citizens, having no
political affairs to engage their attention, and but
little interest in philosophical discussion, gave themselves
up largely to gossip and other equally profitless
ways of passing time.</p>

<p class='c007'>Plutarch was descended from one of the most prominent
families of his native town. He received an
excellent education, according to the standard of his
day. He also seems to have given instruction informally
and without pay, as he shared the prejudices
of his countrymen against receiving compensation for
such service. We do not know much of his private life
or of his family connections. Living as he did the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>quiet life of a peaceable man, absorbed in his books
and his studies and only appearing in public when
his duties as a good citizen called him forth, there
was little in his career to attract the attention of a
biographer. Almost all that we know about him has
to be gleaned from occasional references in his own
writings. It has been aptly said of him that the
prince of biographers is himself without a biographer.
His father’s name is not recorded. That of his
grandfather was Lamprias. We do not know how
many brothers and sisters he had, though he speaks
of two brothers with whom he lived on the most
amicable terms. Of these, Timon is an interlocutor
in the dialogue De Sera. His wife’s name was Timoxena.
By her he had four sons and one daughter.
The latter and the oldest son died when quite young.</p>

<p class='c007'>Plutarch’s wife seems to have been an excellent
woman and to have shared her husband’s views as to
the proper conduct of life. She was plain in dress
and appearance, averse to show and parade, devoted
to her husband, her children, and her household affairs.</p>

<p class='c007'>Plutarch made some journeys beyond the bounds
of his native land; one at least as far as Alexandria
in Egypt. He spent some time in Rome where he
gave lectures in Greek; for as he himself tells us he
never learned the Latin language well. He went
thither on public business, and is thought to have
visited other parts of Italy on a similar errand. His
fame had preceded him to the imperial city where he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>was already known by reputation to some of the literati,
and he embraced the opportunity to enlarge the circle
of his acquaintances. Athens he visited a number of
times, and Sparta at least once. Yet, notwithstanding
his celebrity in his lifetime, and in striking contrast
to his fame in modern times, he is not quoted by any
extant Roman writer, and but rarely by his own
countrymen.</p>

<p class='c007'>As a patriotic citizen and an admirer of all that was
venerable and worthy of preservation in the history
no less than in the traditions of Greece, Plutarch felt
it incumbent upon him to discharge both civil and
religious duties as occasion called him. He was a
priest of Apollo to whose worship he was ardently devoted
and to whom he frequently refers in his
works, among others in the De Sera. As a consequence
he interested himself greatly in the religious
festivals that occurred so frequently in Delphi near
by. It is also plain from his writings that he kept
open house. People who desired to learn, and all who
took life seriously, were always welcome. In some of
the young men who came to him for enlightenment,
whom, nevertheless, we cannot regard as his pupils
except in the Socratic sense, he took a lifelong interest.
The choice of many of the subjects discussed
in his lectures was probably accidental. They were
proposed by persons who visited him, talked over at
the time, but afterwards more fully investigated and
the results written out. It this way light was thrown
upon them both by the oral contributions of an intelligent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>company and also by the aid of books, of
which he had a large collection.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c010'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Plutarch was a man who strove not only to make
others wiser, but also to become wiser himself. His
aim was to be a living exemplar of the doctrines he
professed and taught. He was a firm believer in plain
living and high thinking. He disliked as strongly as
he disliked anything the costly and luxurious banquets
so much affected by the rich Romans of his
day. The little company that so frequently came together
under his hospitable roof met, not to eat and
drink, but to engage in serious and profitable conversation.
The viands were plain—a secondary matter;
the chief thing was the discussion. This often
turned on the most trivial subjects, for the host seems
to have thought with Terence:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Homo sum, et nihil humani a me alienum puto.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Practical politics for a Greek of Plutarch’s day did
not mean serious business, especially for the citizen of
a small municipality like Chaeroneia. He had therefore
ample time for studying, lecturing and formulating
his numerous writings. He was not only so
fortunate as to have a good memory, but he began at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>an early age to take notes on what he read; in this
way he accumulated the large stock of quotations so
profusely scattered through his writings. In fact this
practice of depending upon others for his information
must have done a good deal toward weakening his
power of original thought, and he usually enforces a
precept by an apt quotation rather than by arguments
that he has himself elaborated. On the other hand,
his frequent reference to older authors has given a
special value to his writings in the eyes of the
moderns. Though not quoted by any extant Roman
writer and rarely by a Greek he must have been much
read soon after his death, and at no time was he
wholly forgotten. His early and continued popularity
doubtless contributed not a little to the preservation
of so large a portion of his writings; but it also
put into circulation under his name a number of spurious
works—just how many cannot be determined.
Yet it is certain that some genuine writings have been
lost. Among the earliest printed books were portions
of Plutarch.</p>

<p class='c007'>Plutarch is a prolix but not a pedantic nor a tedious
writer. Though he displays immense erudition
he does so without effort. An apt quotation from
one of the poets, a telling anecdote of some celebrated
man or woman, or historical incident seems always
ready to his hand, and waiting for a suitable place to
be used. He is completely master of the extensive
stock of knowledge stored up in his mind or his notes.
He is a capital story-teller. He knows how to seize
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>the salient features of a situation, and can place them
before the reader in the most effective light. A large
proportion of the anecdotes of illustrious men, belonging
to a remoter antiquity, current in modern literature,
have found their way into it through the medium
of his writings. He often reminds one of Herodotus
notwithstanding his antipathy to this author,
and whose veracity he vigorously impeaches in one
of his essays—assuming, of course, that De Malignitate
is really the work of Plutarch. Like Herodotus,
he often wanders from the main theme of his narrative,
but never loses sight of it, and always returns
to it without unduly distracting the reader’s attention.
Like Herodotus, he is often reminded of a “little
story” that he forthwith proceeds to tell; and, as in
the case of Herodotus, the reader feels that something
of value has been added to the narrative by the
story. Like Herodotus, too, he exhibits a strange
mixture of credulity with sterling good sense. So it
happens that the Father of History and the man
whom Jean Paul Richter calls the Biographical
Shakespeare of Universal History often meet on common
ground, in spite of the aversion of the one to
the other. Of course the canvas on which the historian
paints is much larger; the interests he discusses
are much more momentous; but he does
not treat them with greater seriousness than does
the biographer and moralist.</p>

<p class='c007'>Perhaps the most succinct statement of Plutarch’s
creed is a passage in Isis and Osiris. He says:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>“For God is not a being that is without intelligence,
without a soul, and subject to men, but we regard
these as gods who constantly and in sufficient measure
furnish us these fruits, and there are neither
different gods among different peoples, some barbarian
some Greek, some northern, some southern; but
just as the sun and moon, heaven and earth and sea
are common to all, but are differently designated by
different peoples, so there is but one intelligence
that arranges all those things about us in order and
one Providence to which other powers that direct all
things are made subordinate, some of which have, by
custom, received different honors and appellations
among different peoples. The initiates also employ
different symbols, some clearer, others more obscure,
that lead the mind to what is divine, though not without
risk (of being misunderstood). For some, being
altogether led astray, fall into superstition; others
again, having steered clear of superstition, as if it were
a bog, fall into atheism as from a precipice. On this
account it is especially important to take reason that
is born of philosophy, as a guide through these mysteries,
in order that we may comprehend rightly
everything that is said and done, in its true significance.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Plutarch is a philosopher in the sense that every
man of sound mind may be a philosopher; but he is
not, strictly speaking, a philosophical thinker. He
does not hold to any carefully elaborated and consistent
system. While he has much to say about character
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>and conduct, he rarely attempts to fathom the
motives that underlie and influence conduct. He is
at times inconsistent with himself because his views on
transcendental problems have not been systematically
wrought out and firmly fixed. If he can quote the
authority of some great name in support of a position
he takes, it generally suffices him. Not unfrequently
he cites contradictory authorities both for facts and
opinions, then declares which he prefers without
giving a reason for his preference.</p>

<p class='c007'>Plutarch’s Moralia or Moral Writings are so called
for the reason that they are more or less concerned
with ethical problems. But they also treat incidentally
of matters religious, political, literary, psychological,
physical and metaphysical or philosophical.
Many of his treatises are in the form of dialogues,
in which he doubtless had before his mind’s
eye his great prototype Plato, little as he is able to
fathom his speculative profundity. Sometimes his
discussions are addressed to a real or imaginary
interlocutor, who has, however, little to say. His discourses
may be regarded as sermons or lectures
addressed to a small circle of interested listeners, or
even to a single person, though in reality intended
for a larger public. The homiletic character of many
of Plutarch’s discourses is also attested by the fact
that he regards morals as closely connected with
religion. He is the bitter enemy of atheism, because,
as he maintains, it leads to a dissolute and aimless
life. He was, however, in no sense an innovator, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>ardently attached to the traditions of his countrymen.
He seeks to discover a hidden meaning in the popular
myths and cults, and to explain them on philosophical
grounds. His attitude in this respect has
contributed a good deal to the popular interest in the
man. He is a self-consecrated priest of the established
religion which he defended, not because it was to his
personal profit to do so, but from conviction. As he
will not or can not discard the cults of his day, or
treat them as founded on mere figments of the imagination,
it is incumbent upon him to explain them as
best he can. And he seems to be convinced that he
has been entirely successful.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not only is he an avowed foe of atheism, but
he is an equally vigorous opponent of superstition.
Yet it is often impossible to see where he draws the
line between what he regards as rational faith and
mere credulity; between his own creed and that of
the populace. In truth, the task is not an easy one
for anybody. The German nicely designates the
close proximity of faith and credulity by the two
terms <i>Glaube</i> and <i>Aberglaube</i>. There was hardly
a man in the ancient world of whom we have any
considerable knowledge, even though he may have
been an avowed atheist, who was wholly without
superstition. The destiny of individuals and nations
was so often decided by influences so mysterious and
inscrutable that it might well be attributed to the
miraculous interposition of the gods. Even in our
day, when the laws of nature are better understood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>than ever before, men still feel themselves the sport
of unseen forces and powers that often seem to be
malevolent or benevolent for no discoverable reason,
and which, it is hard to believe, are not controlled by
a supernal will.</p>

<p class='c007'>Plutarch’s merits as a historical writer are seriously
impaired by his readiness to believe everything that
comes to him through tradition or record. Still one
ought not to blame him for not being what he does
not profess to be. His main purpose is not to attain
historical truth, but to discover what will “point a
moral, or adorn a tale.” Had he been other than he
was he would never have been so assiduously read.</p>

<p class='c007'>Plutarch fully recognized the importance of the
family in the social fabric. This is the more to his
credit for the reason that the trend of public opinion
was against him in this respect. All the evidence
we have goes to show that he was a judicious father,
a loving husband, a dutiful son, and an affectionate
brother. He is thus a zealous defender of the virtues
he himself exemplified. A knowledge of his character,
as shown by his conduct, contributes not
a little to the pleasure the modern reader finds in
the perusal of his pages. How often, alas! do we
discover on closer examination a great gulf between
what men write and what they do! How often does
a knowledge of the private life of a great writer mar
the interest we take in what he writes!</p>

<p class='c007'>Though a man of kind heart and polished manners,
judged by the standard of his time, Plutarch was no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>reformer. Indeed, no reform was possible by means
of his didactic method. He does not denounce
vigourously the corruptions of his time. He is far
from employing the drastic speech of his Roman
contemporaries. It is probable that in his secluded
home he did not know or even suspect the moral
degradation of the world around him; it is certain
he had not fathomed it. He knows something of the
Jewish religion, and might have known more, had he
cared to inform himself. He might have heard
Paul’s preaching; and Christianity had gained a firm
foothold in Greece before Plutarch’s death. But he
was too much of a Greek to take any interest in what
had no relation either to Greek religion or tradition.
The new faith in virtue of its origin, was foolishness
to him. He considered the Hellenic religion good
enough for anybody and everybody. It might indeed
need purification from some of its grosser elements
and exotic excrescences; but more than this was
wholly unnecessary.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nothing that Plutarch says exhibits in a more
striking light the humaneness of his disposition
than his exhortations to the kind treatment of brutes.
He believes that the good man is kind to his beast.
He regards it a duty to care for the horse and the
dog that have served him well, when they become old
and useless. He seems to think that animals are
not without a measure of reason and that they have
to a limited extent, the power to decide between
right and wrong. Though possessed of only a modicum
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>of intelligence, this at least cannot be entirely
denied to them, any more than it can be denied to a
bad man. A certain measure of reason is the gift of
nature; perfect and virtuous reason is the result of
practice and instruction. The reasoning powers of
many animals are, to an extent, on a level with those
of man; they differ not so much in quality as in
quantity. It is right, therefore, to use but not to
abuse them. Cruelty to animals is evidence of a
base heart. Those who treat them harshly usually
accentuate their bad traits in their dealings with men.
Our treatment of animals is, therefore, in some sort
and often to a considerable extent, an index of how
we treat our fellow beings. Plutarch finds the lower
animals in some respects more rational than men.
They never eat or drink more than enough to satisfy
hunger and thirst; nor do they give way to any unnatural
or excessive appetites. He is somewhat
inclined to condemn the use of animal food; but, at
any rate, animals must not be cruelly dealt with to
make them more palatable, nor put to death by
lingering and inhuman methods. He had in view
more particularly some of the practices prevalent in
Rome in his day,—practices that were, in truth, horrible
in the extreme. It is no wonder that he names
them only to condemn them. The extreme modernness
of Plutarch in this matter becomes the more
strikingly evident when we remember that classical
antiquity not only very seldom has a kind word for
irrational creatures, but was wont to treat them with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>extreme harshness. This was particularly the case
among the Romans.</p>

<p class='c007'>Plutarch regards the soul as composed of two parts.
One part seeks after truth and light; the other is
under the influence of the passions, and liable to
error. The first is divine, the second carnal. In so
far as a man heeds the monitions of the former he
will follow the path of virtue. Practical virtue, virtue
in action, is wisdom; vice is error. In order to be
virtuous it is only necessary to listen to the voice of
reason. Plutarch does not doubt that virtue can be
taught. To teach virtue consists largely in making it
attractive to the young. Reason does not annihilate
the passions; it merely directs them toward a goal
that it has marked out. Virtue consists in “the
golden mean”—μηδὲν ἄγαν—in doing neither too
much nor too little. Bravery is a virtue whose place
is between cowardice and rashness. Mildness or
kindness is a virtue: its place is between stolidity and
cruelty, just as the place of liberality is midway between
the extremes, stinginess and prodigality. He
adduces a number of proofs to establish the position
that the passions are corporeal and the reason supersensuous;
in a correct system of pedagogy a proper
use is to be made of the latter for controlling and
wisely directing the former toward rational ends. It
is in every man’s power to be virtuous under all circumstances,
but happiness, or rather good fortune, is
dependent upon many things. A virtuous man may
enjoy peace of mind at all times, while the largest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>possessions are of no real value to a bad man. Vice
is an anomaly in the constitution of society. Tranquillity
of mind, calmness of soul, are not to be
sought in a state of inactivity and in retirement. The
affirmative of this proposition has led many people
into error. Disgusted with the world, they seek peace
by withdrawing from its turmoil and hurly-burly, too
often only to meet with disappointment. There is
not a condition in life from which no consolation can
be extracted, and it is the province of reason to discover
how this may be done. In what way this is
possible he shows by a number of examples from
biography. What many persons at first looked upon
as misfortunes not unfrequently turned out to be a
blessing to themselves and to the world. On the
other hand, many persons who were regarded by
almost every one as among the most fortunate, were
found to have a skeleton in their closet. When the
sage suffers a loss, he does not grieve over it, but
places a higher value on what is left to him. No
man is so poor, no man has lost so much, but that
there remains in his possession something for which
he can felicitate himself. Neither is any one so
destitute but that he might be still worse off, and the
most wretched are certain to meet with others more
needy than themselves. On the physical side of our
nature we are all subject to what, for want of a better
name, may be called <i>chance</i>; but this is not true of
our moral and intellectual side. It is therefore within
our power to secure indestructible and inalienable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>possessions: insight, love of knowledge, virtue, the
consciousness of being and doing right. Not even
the fear of death disquiets the good man, for he knows
that after his dissolution he shall enter into a better
state of existence than this life; the bad man clings
to life because of the dread uncertainty before him
after death. As a last resource, if a man’s sufferings
become too great to be endured, he can make an end
of them with his own hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>To Plutarch, no riches, no purely external possessions,
are so conducive to peace of mind and cheerfulness
of heart, as a soul that has kept itself free
from evil thoughts and acts. For a soul that has
held itself aloof from contamination every day is a
festival; the world, a temple in which God dwells and
which he has adapted to the fulfilment of man’s
wants. By the proper use of reason men may control
their passions and find satisfaction in the enjoyment
of what is within their reach. They may reflect
with complacency on the past and look forward to
the future with hope. A man’s unhappiness is caused
rather by the pains of the soul than those of the
body. Diseases of the body are due to its nature,
but disease of the soul is man’s own work. Moreover
the maladies of the soul are curable, a condition
of things that ought to afford us much consolation.
Though the sufferings and diseases to which the
body is subject take many forms, those that a corrupt
heart and a debased soul send forth, as from a
perennial fountain, are much more numerous. Again,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>corporal diseases may be detected by their external
symptoms; the maladies of the soul are hidden.
They are the more dangerous from the fact that, in
most instances, the patient himself is not aware of
them. The greatest malady of the soul is the want
of reason and good sense, because they disqualify
men from recognizing their own baseness and the
remedies necessary for a cure. Few persons who are
guilty of wrong-doing realize that they have committed
transgressions; oftentimes they even think
they have acted wisely and judiciously. They call
their anger, bravery; their envy and jealousy, emulation;
their cowardice, prudence; while it never occurs
to them to seek the aid of a philosopher for the
diseases of the soul until they are incurable and have
become so virulent that they drive the patient to the
commission of the most diabolical crimes.</p>

<p class='c007'>From these premises there follows the inevitable
conclusion that the chief end of man is progress in
virtue, or, we might better say, in all the virtues,
though virtue in reality is but one. Our progress in
philosophy is the result of constant and uninterrupted
effort. Parallel to this is our progress in virtue;
if we relax our efforts for a moment we incur
the danger of letting vice get a hold upon us. He
who is always in conflict with vice, with his evil
passions, may rest assured that he is making progress
in virtue. But our love for virtue must partake of
the nature of a passion; in it we ought to find our
highest gratification, so that if we are interrupted in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>our pursuit we shall long to return to it. The aim
and purpose of our philosophy must be practical, and
it is chiefly in our activity as a citizen and a man in
all the multiplex relations of life, that we may test
our love for it. Yet, the true philosopher is not
ostentatious, and it makes little difference to him
whether the world recognizes him as such or not.
He ought to seek internal satisfaction, not public
acknowledgement. Herein Plutarch takes his stand
in opposition to many of his countrymen who aspired
to the name and title of philosophers, but did little
to deserve them. How men of sense regarded them
has been pointed out elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c007'>We may also measure our progress in philosophy,
that is, in virtue, by our love of the beautiful and the
good; by our attitude towards praise and blame.
We ought neither to seek the one nor avoid the
other. If we really desire to correct our faults and
shortcomings, we will be ready at all times to listen
to advice and to heed criticism; nor will we conceal
any part of our nature or cover up any of our acts in
order to seem what we are not. Nevertheless, when
we are firmly convinced that we are in the right, it is
our duty to go forward in the course we have marked
out for ourselves, no matter what others may think
or say.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is no stronger incentive to noble deeds and
an upright life than the lives of the great and the
good of all ages. It was mainly under the impulse
of this belief that Plutarch compiled his parallel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>biographies. In the nature of the case their value as
truthful records is greatly impaired by the standpoint
from which they were written; but it is this
fact that has given them an attractiveness and a currency
such as no other works of their kind have
equalled. Plutarch’s Lives have for centuries been
the monitors of youth and the solace of the aged.
They have been read and admired wherever men have
honored courage, fortitude, intrepidity, self-control,
patriotism, humaneness—in short, every trait of
character that can be classed among the virtues.
Greeks and Romans, ancients and moderns, learned
and illiterate, rich and poor, have been fascinated by
them, and it is on them that their author’s fame
chiefly rests. To many persons, in fact to the great
majority of readers, Plutarch is known only as the
writer of charming biographies; yet these constitute
a good deal less than half his extant works.</p>

<p class='c007'>Plutarch holds that men find the path of virtue
and continue to walk in it, by reflection, deliberation,
introspection; by a systematic, rigid and continued
self-examination—in other words, by a practical application
of the methods that philosophy points out.
Man is sane and sound only so long as he puts into
practice the principles of virtue. So long as he is
the slave of his passions he is in need of a physician.
Philosophy is the sanitation of the soul; the genuine
philosopher is the real physician of the soul. In
pursuance of his chosen vocation, Plutarch wrote a
number of essays for the purpose of giving instruction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>upon the best methods of controlling the different
passions to which men are subject. Their purport
easily becomes evident from a glance at their titles.
They show that he has carefully observed and studied
men, at least those that constitute the various higher
classes and give the prevailing tone to society. Many
of these essays are still of interest and well repay
perusal. They contain many acute observations and
piquant remarks.</p>

<p class='c007'>For Plutarch the old mythology is sufficient as a
basis for a religious belief. Like most of the Greek
philosophers who incline toward theism, he maintains
that myths are, to a greater or less extent, corruptions
of primitive verities. These originated in
the popular mind and received artistic form at the
hands of the poets. Underlying them all there is
truth enough and beauty enough to show the aspiration
of the soul after higher things, and they form
the basis of a purely theistic belief. Plutarch’s unbounded
faith in human reason leads him to believe
that it alone is entirely sufficient to enable any and
every man to lead a virtuous life. His advice to
every one is, in substance: get all the light you can;
use the reason you are endowed with by the creator;
acquire additional knowledge and wisdom every day;
make your inward life an object of daily study and
reflection,—if you do these things you will lead a virtuous
life. Those persons who have no love for the
beautiful and the good, no desire to become virtuous,
fail because they neglect to cultivate the reason with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>which every man is originally endowed. They grope
in the darkness cast about them by their own passions,
and refuse to follow the lamp that reason holds
up before them. Plutarch’s optimism; his faith in
the power of the intellect to make the world better, is
especially remarkable in view of the fact that his
countrymen, notwithstanding their general intelligence,
notwithstanding the large number of great
men in almost every department of knowledge born
in Greek lands, in spite of the fact that Greece was
the native hearth of philosophy, had for centuries
been retrograding morally, intellectually and politically.
So hard is it to divorce most men from a
theory to which they have attached themselves. His
mistake arose from his seeing all men in the mirror
of his own thoughts. He believed that the whole
human race could be influenced by the motives that
influenced himself, and that all could, if they wished,
be constantly engaged in the search for light and
wisdom in the way he sought them. This radical
error he inherited from his master, Plato, and it is
strange that he did not detect it. He seems never to
have suspected that he might be mistaken.</p>

<p class='c007'>Plutarch’s religion is wholly without enthusiasm
and his morality has in it not a tinge of emotion.
Do right always, because by such a course of life
you will enjoy the largest measure of mundane happiness
that can fall to the lot of a mortal, and be a
benefactor to all who come within the circle of your
influence. Make the best of every situation in which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>you may be placed. Do not take too seriously the
hindrances to a virtuous life that you may find in
your way, because you can remove them if you will.
No matter what your station in life, do not expect
your path to be always a smooth one. If you keep
these things in mind you will probably live long,—you
are sure to live happily.</p>

<p class='c007'>Plutarch’s views regarding the education of
women are far in advance of his age. He follows his
master, Plato, in vindicating for them the same
virtues that belong to men. His treatise often designated
The Virtues of Women is chiefly a record of
heroic deeds that have been performed by the so-called
weaker sex. He admits that the worth or
efficiency of women is not necessarily of the same
quality as that of men, but he contends that its
ethical value is equal and its intrinsic merit in no
wise inferior. The woman who has performed a
noble deed is entitled to just as much credit as a
a man. He takes issue with Thucydides for saying
that the best woman is the one of whom least is
said either for good or evil. He also takes issue with
the thoroughly Greek sentiment, though perhaps
more pronounced in Athens than elsewhere, that
woman is at most little else than a plaything and a
convenience for man; and that her highest function
is to bear legitimate male children. According to
Plutarch the wife is to be the equal partner in the
management of the household. When it is well conducted
she deserves equal commendation with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>husband. He would open a wider sphere for women;
train them intellectually, and awaken in them an
interest in the larger affairs of life. Consistently with
these views, Plutarch assigned to his wife an honorable
place in his household. She received guests in
her husband’s absence; sat at table with him and interested
herself in public as well as private affairs.
While this was in contravention of the custom of his
day, it was in harmony with a faintly discernible
trend of public opinion, probably the result of Roman
influence. That the innovation made slow progress
is plain not only from the later history of Greece but
also from Greek social usages in our own day. When
we take cognizance of the unhappy state of his country
we are inclined to wonder at Plutarch’s uniform
serenity of mind. He never indulges in satire or
sneer, while many of his contemporaries did both.
But we must remember that his philosophy had, above
and beyond everything else, a practical purpose, and
that in a rather material sense. Men’s misfortunes
are their own fault and therefore preventible; or they
are not their own fault and therefore unavoidable.
In either case nothing is gained by grieving over them.</p>

<p class='c007'>It will be evident from a perusal of the De Sera
that optimism is the basis of Plutarch’s philosophy.
Men can do right if they will, and if they do right
they can not fail to be happy. There is a superintending
Providence that in the end rectifies all
wrong and injustice. He seems to hold with Goethe
that “Every sin is punished here below,” though the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>punishment does not end in this life. Retribution
is not delayed until after death; it visits the sinner in
this world. Or if he is so fortunate as to end his
days in peace, so far as mortals can see, he entails a
curse upon his descendants. The iniquities of
the fathers are visited upon the children unto the
third and fourth generation. But the punishment of
the wicked does not end with this life. The soul
bears the imprint of its crimes after it has left the
body. That God sometimes permits a wicked man to
end his days in peace but that He has fastened a curse
on his offspring, is a prominent article in the creed
of many of the older Greek writers. It is often referred
to by Herodotus. So firmly convinced is he
that all wrong-doing must be atoned for that when he
finds an instance where the law does not appear to
hold good he confesses himself at a loss to account
for the failure of its operation. Not only individuals
but nations as well must expiate crimes committed
and wrongs done by their representatives in an
official capacity. And there is no doubt that the influence
of this belief was most wholesome. Much of
what Plutarch says on this point is probably fanciful,
especially when he appeals to the testimony of
history; but what he records is in keeping with
his philosophy and has therefore a strong personal
interest. Moreover, he furnishes us with some interesting
testimony as to the prevalence of a belief in
rewards and punishments among men outside the
pale of Christianity.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>Plutarch’s ideal of duty is a high one. The fulfilment
of some duty is incumbent upon every man
so long as he lives. It is as imperative in old age as
in early life. When a man is quit of his obligations
to his children, he owes a service to his country and
to his fellow citizens in a narrower sense. From
this service, only the impairment of his facilities or
death may release him. As every man is born into
the state, and as, in a certain sense, he is a man only
in so far as he discharges his obligations to the state,
he has no choice in the matter. Herein lies a duty
from which there is no possible escape. But the
mere holding of an office is not the only or even the
chief test of the good citizen. His duties in a private
capacity are no less important, and if less conspicuous
are equally far reaching. The good citizen
is the philosopher in his true sphere: good citizenship
is philosophy in action—applied philosophy.
It is only in actual life that the philosopher can put
his theories to the test. The form of government is
a matter of minor importance. Plutarch regards
monarchy, as on the whole, the best, but he is not
radical. In this he agrees with the majority of
Greek philosophers, most of whom were generally
more or less dissatisfied with the turbulent Athenian
democracy. That monarchy is best where the head of
the state is what Plutarch would have him be, a philosopher.
But even the most absolute monarch should
not regard himself above law; he is to be its executor.
Moreover, it is his duty not only to obey cheerfully
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>the written law that binds prince and people alike,
but also that unwritten law that reason has implanted
in the soul of every man of sound mind. Rulers are
in a sense the servants of God whose duty it is to apportion
rewards and punishments according to their
deserts, to all that are under their authority.</p>

<p class='c007'>After all, man’s first and chief duty is to himself.
His quest for light, for knowledge, for truth is never to
be intermitted. He is to take his bearings, as it were,
frequently, in order to see what progress he is
making. If his aims are noble, his purposes
right, and his motives pure, he will not only
make daily progress in virtue, but when he is
called to leave this world he can depart in peace because
he will have the consciousness that it is the
better for his having lived in it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having thus given a short sketch of Plutarch as a
man and a citizen let us proceed to examine briefly
the times in which he lived as supplementary to what
has already been said under this general head in
treating of Seneca. What had Roman rule done for
his country? What was the social and economic condition
of Greece and Greek lands in the first century
of the Christian era? Unfortunately our information
on these points is exceedingly scanty. In fact, political
economy is a recent science; in ancient times
the lot of the poor was little taken note of. It was
everywhere a hard one, and the care of the indigent,
so much insisted on in the New Testament, is almost
the first sign of an awakening in this respect. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>it did not originate with the government; that had
other ends in view. That the Roman policy toward
the proletariat in the imperial capital only made
matters worse, is well known. When we remember
how much has been done in recent years by legislation
in every civilized country for the amelioration of
the condition of the lowest classes and how much
still remains to be done, we can picture to ourselves
the state of society where all this was omitted.</p>

<p class='c007'>When we remember further that up to a comparatively
recent period commerce, trade and manufactures
flourished, in so far as they can be said to have flourished,
not because they were fostered by governments,
but almost in spite of them, it is not surprising that
they received little attention at the hands of the
Greeks and Romans, either individually or collectively.
It has already been stated that the sole object
of the ruling powers was to raise the largest amount
of revenue, not to equalize the burdens on all the
subjects. On no question is ancient thought so crude
as upon economics. The blight of slavery that made
free labor to a certain extent disgraceful, and a condition
of things that hindered the establishment of
manufacturies on a large scale, tells the sorrowful
story.</p>

<p class='c007'>In his attitude toward slavery, Plutarch does
not seem to hold as advanced views as Seneca
and some of the better men of his age and preceding
times. Yet he did not endorse the prevalent
opinion, embodied in legislation, that a slave is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>a soulless thing, though the justice of emancipation
occupied his attention but little. Here again we find
his practical ideas in the foreground. He is concerned
to make the best of the situation as he finds
it. Slavery exists, is an ineradicable element of organized
society and is coextensive with the human
race. The best that the philosopher can do is to
make sages of slave-holders, to the end that they treat
their bondmen with justice and humaneness. Compare
the anecdotes of Plato and Archytas in De Sera,
Chap. 5. According to Plutarch slaves have souls
like other human beings, and are capable of mental
and moral improvement; consequently masters have
duties to perform toward them that are just as plain
and just as imperative as those due to persons
on the same social level with themselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>The prosperity of nations rests mainly upon the
numbers and intelligence of its middle classes. It
can everywhere be measured by the rise of this
class. What wonder then that the nations were
poor among whom it scarcely existed? Rome could
not go on plundering interminably, and the riches
of its provinces in time became exhausted because
not replenished. All that the ancient world has
left upon record for us, proceeds upon the assumption
of a large body of slaves and a small body of free
citizens, and breathes a contempt for labor and trade.
In most of the Greek states the commercial and
manufacturing class consisted chiefly of resident
aliens who were also slave-holders, and no citizen was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>so poor that he did not own at least one slave. To be
a slave-owner was a badge of respectability even for
those who were not citizens. In the Greek states, so
long as they were free polities, war and religion occupied
all the time and attention of the citizens, except
that small body that were interested in philosophical
pursuits. When they were no longer free
and no longer had serious affairs in which to employ
their time, they spent most of it in idle gossip or as
the Acts tell us, “in hearing or telling some new
thing.” What legislation they were still permitted
to engage in never concerned matters of grave import.
They decreed crowns and statues to real or supposed
benefactors, only to annul their decrees when
those whom they were intended to honor happened
to incur the displeasure of the legislators or to
fall into disgrace with the higher powers. Then
there were deputations between different states about
boundary disputes, about festivals, about claims and
counter claims of all sorts, the sending of which was
often debated with a solemnity that makes us wonder
how the participants could themselves fail to see their
farcical character. Generally the game at stake was
the favor of the emperor, each party striving to outbid
the other in professions of loyalty or to outvie it
in the length of its bill for services rendered. When,
as was frequently the case, these delegations did not
find the emperor in Rome, they had, of course, to follow
him into provinces or to await his return. This required
time that, we may be sure, was in most cases
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>ungrudgingly given. Instead of directing their energies
into channels of activity and trying by honest
work to better their worldly condition it was talk,
talk with the Greeks, and talk without end.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is no stronger evidence of their fondness for
discussion and for listening to the spoken word than
Greek literature itself. The historians are in the
habit of stating the case of opposing parties by harangues
which they put into the mouth of a representative
of each. Greek poetry consists in a great
measure of dialogue. Philosophy was chiefly developed
by means of oral discussion. Comedy, even
after it was no longer represented on the stage, still
appears as dialogue and not in the usual form of the
satire. Among its richest legacies to posterity is its
oratory, and in it we have the spoken word in its
most effective form; but it still represents words
rather than deeds, and belongs for the most part to
the declining age of Greece. A solitary thinker like
Kant was wholly foreign to Greek ideas. So persistently
has this trait remained a characteristic of
the Hellenes that many of their best friends deplore
their fondness for petty politics; their sleepless anxiety
to assist in the management of the government
instead of turning their attention to bettering their
material condition by a steady devotion to private
business. Many of the rich and well-to-do Greeks
live outside the kingdom of Greece where their lingual
activity is circumscribed and they are compelled
by circumstances to turn their energies into more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>profitable channels. Rarely has a man, distinguished
for eloquence alone, profoundly influenced the course
of human events. Contemporaries are unanimous in
ascribing to Julius Caesar oratorical gifts of the
highest order; but he preferred to make his mark as
a doer of deeds rather than as a maker of phrases.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Rome the economic conditions were somewhat
different from those prevailing in Greece and the
East, yet Rome was not a commercial state. It was
founded on military power, extended by valor and
endurance in war, and when there were no more
worlds to conquer, the forces that had been turned
against external enemies began to be turned against
herself. Rome was rich while she had other countries
to plunder; when this was no longer possible her
decay began. And these countries, by which we
mean all the provinces outside of the city, were rich
so long as the fertility of their soil continued and
their mines were productive. That Rome’s moral
decline antedated her economic retrogression by
centuries is familiar to every reader of ancient history,
but it is only the latter that we are concerned with here.</p>

<p class='c007'>Money was not used for purposes of production,
but for the purchase of articles of luxury and display.
Much of what had been accumulated in the capital
flowed eastward and disappeared. Italy gradually
passed into the hands of a small number of largelanded
proprietors, whose vast estates were cultivated by
persons who had no interest in maintaining their
fertility. Great numbers of free citizens flocked to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>Rome to enjoy the doles distributed to the populace
at stated intervals; to feast their eyes on the bloody
spectacles, so frequently and so magnificently given;
and to die, only to leave room to be filled by the constantly
inflowing stream. The empire existed for
the City, its capital. We have already spoken of the
strange fascination it exercised over all who had once
been under its spell. We may safely assume that of
the eighty thousand Romans put to death by Mithridates
in his dominions, a considerable portion had
gone abroad in the hope of enriching themselves in
order to spend their gains in the capital. Doubtless,
too, so far afield, trade was less despised than at the
seat of government. The empire built, and for a
time kept in repair, those magnificent highways that
are still the admiration of all who see them. But they
served military purposes almost exclusively. When
no longer needed they were suffered to fall into decay.
They were not constructed to facilitate commercial
intercourse, and contributed little to the economic
welfare of the empire. When the lack of
local improvements was sufficiently felt and the people
were not too much impoverished, which was seldom
the case, to bear the necessary financial burdens
these were undertaken by the local authorities. But
there is reason to believe that some of the provinces,
notably the Grecian, became poorer and poorer from
year to year. The capital drained the province; the
people lost heart, and gave themselves up to the apathy
of indifference or despair.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>It was the evil destiny of the Greek polities that
they could never be brought to act together for any
length of time; nor did all of them ever act together
in any common enterprise. And they learned nothing
from experience. The misfortunes resulting from
this centripetal tendency were pointed out time and
again by writers and orators, but to no purpose.
Local pride always outweighed the dictates of reason
or even of common prudence. Had Greece presented
a united front, under competent leadership, it would
have been a hard task for even Rome to subdue it.
But it was impossible for the different states to forget
their reciprocal animosities: the increasing prosperity
of one was usually the signal for others to
turn their arms against it. In this way all of them
were gradually weakened and thus became a comparatively
easy prey to any strong foreign foe that
might choose to attack them. Their subjugation by
Rome was by far the greatest misfortune that ever
befell them. Philip of Macedon and his successors
were at least more than half Greeks, and had a good
deal of sympathy with Greek ideas. The Romans
had none whatever. Still, cruelly as they carried out
the work of subjugation in certain localities, when
their first animosity was appeased they seem not to
have interfered systematically with existing municipal
administrations. Yet the financial pressure became
harder as the people grew poorer, and matters
went from bad to worse. The wickedness of Corinth,
the most Roman of Greek cities after it had been rebuilt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>under imperial auspices, affords striking evidence
of what Roman influence meant on the morals
of a Greek polity.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is a matter of common knowledge what Roman
internecine war brought upon Italy. To a certain
extent the same evils were shared by Greece. Three
of the fiercest battles between the contestants for the
principate were fought in or near Greece. The
Greeks were always on the losing side, though her
soldiers were not numerously represented in the
Roman armies. These battles did but accelerate a
retrograde movement that had been quite marked at
least since the Mithridatic war, though it did not
begin then. The population was rapidly decreasing.
Plutarch says that in his time all Greece could not
furnish three thousand heavy-armed soldiers. This
statement must not be taken too literally; it can
hardly mean that there were not this number of able-bodied
men in the whole of Greece; it must mean
that it did not contain three thousand citizens sufficiently
well-to-do to enable them to support themselves
in the field. In the days of their glory some
of the smallest Greek states were better off than this
would indicate. It is certainly proof positive of
poverty, if not of a very sparse population. But
this, too, had greatly decreased in some places. In
the time of Augustus, Thebes had ceased to be anything
more than a large village—the same Thebes
that had played so prominent a part in legend and
history. With a few exceptions, the larger Boeotian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>towns were in the same sad plight. Cities without
inhabitants, or only a few; cattle grazing in the deserted
streets, and even in the market-place, seem to
have been a common sight. What had become of
the inhabitants? We only know that they were gone,
most of them, doubtless, to their graves.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Greece, Sparta excepted, slavery was of a rather
mild type, and it was unusual for a Greek to sell a
slave to a foreigner. Neither did gladiatorial combats
flourish among the Greeks. Even Corinth, that
in later times contained a large admixture of Romans,
could not acclimate them. While it is true that the
Greeks made light of human life and took it upon
the slightest pretext, it was rarely done by the cruel
methods of the Romans. With all their faults and
frailties they belonged to a distinctly higher type of
men, and their civilization at a very early period
began to move along lines afterward followed by the
progressive nations of the world. How infinitely
better were their peaceful contests than the bloody
spectacles that were the delight of Rome!</p>

<p class='c007'>Just as the Greeks were reluctant to admit foreigners
to citizenship, they were also reluctant to admit
exotic gods into their pantheon. In both, their policy
was diametrically opposed to that of Rome. Their
exclusiveness in the former regard was due to their
belief in their own superiority; in the latter, to the
conviction that their national gods were sufficient for
all human needs. Friedlaender is probably right in
his contention that the period here under consideration
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>shows no decay in what we may call religion,
either in Greece or Rome. Its external forms and
traditional rites were sedulously kept up and scrupulously
maintained. Plutarch likewise bears testimony
to this condition of things. Scoffers and infidels
had become more numerous, mainly because
the Romans were more tolerant in such matters than
the Greeks. To the ruling class all cults were alike;
consequently they made no objections to anything
that was spoken or written, so long as their authority
was not directly or indirectly attacked. In the various
controversies about religion mentioned in the
New Testament, the attitude of the government is
always one of indifference except as to the maintenance
of public order.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Greeks, generally speaking, preferred, like
Plutarch, the limited sphere of local political activity
to the larger one offered at Rome. The provincials
who came to honor on the other side of the Adriatic
were few in number.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the main the provinces fared better under the
imperial government than under the republic. There
was a higher degree of probability that wrongs would
be redressed. A case in point is that of the apostle
Paul who appealed to Caesar even when the Caesar
was Nero.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is a well-known fact of ancient history that property
in transit, either by land or sea, was at no time
particularly safe at a distance from the centers of population.
The thief and the robber are familiar figures
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>in both sacred and profane writings. Pompey’s extensive
crusade against the pirates that infested all
parts of the Mediterranean forms an important
episode in the records of the Roman navy. Even in
the cities, the unlighted streets afforded frequent opportunities
for plunder and murder to those who had
no scruples about taking life or property. As domestic
affairs from time to time engrossed the attention
of the imperial administration, the outlying
provinces were not carefully looked after; roads were
neglected and became insecure; the police force
lacked efficiency, and commercial intercourse between
the different parts of the empire was reduced to a
minimum. The people were driven to agriculture as
their only means of support, which, in Greece particularly,
was never a profitable industry. Nothing
affords a more striking contrast between the police
system of ancient and modern times than the frequency
with which robberies are mentioned in the
former and their rarity in the other. Paul tells us
that he had been in peril by robbers; we know, too,
from the writings of Josephus and others that the
conflicts between this class of outlaws and the Roman
government were by no means infrequent.
Those who had been engaged in rebellion, or who
were among the vanquished in battle, or who had become
voluntary or compulsory exiles, often felt that
they had a right to prey on orderly society.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is a recognized fact that the monarchical system
of the East tended to encourage immorality, a condition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>of things that usually exists where there is no
strong and wholesome public opinion. The usurpers
in the Greek cities, and later, the Roman provincial
governors, were, with rare exceptions, men of loose
morals if not worse. The private life of its representatives
was a matter with which the home government
did not concern itself, and the subjects were
constrained to be dumb. Now and then one of these
petty sovereigns ruled wisely according to the standards
of the time, and the public was satisfied,
especially if they knew how to maintain brilliant
courts, and to adorn their capitals with imposing
structures. It was so easy to trump up the charge of
sedition against persons who refused to be servile
flatterers, that only the most courageous dared to
stand aloof. Finlay, though somewhat given to painting
in strong colors, is probably not far wrong when
he says: “It is difficult to imagine a society more
completely destitute of moral restraint than that in
which the Asiatic Greeks lived. Public opinion was
powerless to enforce even an outward respect for
virtue; military accomplishments, talents for civil administration,
literary eminence and devotion to the
power of an arbitrary sovereign, were the direct roads
to distinction and wealth; honesty and virtue were
very secondary qualities. In old countries or societies
where a class becomes predominant, a conventional
character is formed, according to the exigencies of
the case, as the standard of an honorable man; and it
is usually very different indeed from what is really
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>necessary to constitute a virtuous or even an honest
citizen.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The student of Greek history is often inclined to
believe that the bane of Hellenic statesmanship was
the bitter rivalry that always existed between the
different polities. From the standpoint of the philosopher
this view is correct. If the energies devoted
to the means and methods of mutual destruction
had been expended on the arts of peace, not only
Greece, but the entire world would, to-day, present a
widely different aspect. However much the moralist
may deplore the existing conditions, the man who
takes the world as it is cannot fail to see that the utmost
strength of a nation is always put forth in war
and for warlike purposes. It was so with the Greeks.
Political rivalry was the strongest stimulus under
which they acted. It was their life and growth, and
to a large extent the measure of their prosperity.
When political rivalries were extinguished by Alexander,
and more effectually by the Romans, the spirit
of Greece, too, died out. The Romans, especially
in their first contact with Greece, were too much
barbarians to have any sympathy with the best that
Greece had to offer. A genius for government is not
necessarily a mark of advanced civilization. It is
true there were at all times men among the Romans
able to appreciate the proud preeminence of the
Greeks in arts and letters, but their numbers were too
few to make any general impression. The leading
families, including most of the emperors, were familiar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>with the Greek language and used it with ease;
but there were few Romans who did not despise the
Greeks and regard them as inferiors. Nations, like
individuals, feel more or less contempt for those whose
tastes are different from their own; and in the case
before us, the Greeks being the weaker, were the chief
sufferers. But just as rich men sometimes buy books
and statuary of which they do not know the value,
and collect libraries which they cannot read, because
intelligent people take pleasure in these things, so a
certain class of Romans affected a fondness for Greek
art and literature and philosophy. An enormous
quantity of works of Greek art was transported across
the Adriatic by the Romans with small advantage to
the pillagers or to the nation. Notwithstanding the
predilection of some of the leading families for Greek
culture, their influence made no deep and lasting
impression on Roman thought, in the better sense.
Rome always showed itself much more receptive
toward what is debasing than for what was ennobling.</p>

<p class='c007'>After this hasty survey of the condition of Plutarch’s
countrymen we are more than ever inclined
to be surprised at his optimism. Yet the explanation
is not far to seek, and is consistent with his
philosophy. He had an abiding faith in a divine
Providence who orders all things for the best. He
holds that men are free and therefore responsible.
The ills that afflict them are chiefly of their own
making; why then should a wise man grieve over
them? It is man’s chief business to free himself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>from unholy desires; to control the volcanic and perturbing
impulses of his nature by means of philosophy,
which when rightly apprehended is divine. As
man is in the last analysis an ethical being, the fundamental
problem of philosophy is how to carry out
in practice those ethical principles in the observance
of which man only can be truly happy. If, then,
men’s misfortunes are the natural consequence and
result of their own perverseness, there is no reason
why we should grieve over them. So far as political
conditions are concerned, he doubtless felt that the
rule of the Roman emperors had at last given peace
to his long distracted country, on as favorable terms
as could be expected.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has been said of Plutarch that there is not a
new thought in all his writings,—and this by way of
disparagement. The charge is probably true. The
men who have put new ideas into the world are few
indeed. The world is far less in need of instruction
than of reminding. Besides, there is no reason why
an artist should not deal with a familiar subject in
his own way. If he can tell an old story so as to
give it a new interest, or treat a well-worn theme so
as to make it seem fresh, he is not the least among
his brethren. It is especially writers upon ethics
that are apt to be tedious. The more honor to him
who can make his preaching attractive and interesting.</p>

<p class='c007'>Perhaps the chief charm of Plutarch’s writings is the
assumption on his part that he is a reasonable man
himself and is talking to reasonable men; for as we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>have already seen, he has always hearers in mind
rather than readers. We can imagine him ever and
anon saying, You either know what is right, what
your duty is, or you want to know. The rules of conduct
are plain and simple; you have but to obey
them and you will be happy. Perform the duties
incumbent upon you, to the gods, to your fellow citizens,
to the members of your family, to yourself, and
you will be content with the present order of things,
and your fellow men with you. If you want to lead
a moral life, be humane, be truthful, be sympathetic,
be chaste, deal honestly with your fellow men, follow
your rational nature rather than your emotions, and
you will have no reason to regret that you have
lived; your fellow men will be glad that you have for
a time sojourned among them, and have left behind
you the light of your example to shine for those who
come after you.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lecky in his History of European Morals, already
cited, has some interesting passages on the relation of
Seneca and Plutarch to certain phases of the thought
of their time, a few of which may properly find a
place here. He says: “A class of writers began to
arise, who, like the Stoics, believed virtue rather than
enjoyment, to be the supreme good, and who acknowledged
that virtue consisted solely of the control
which the enlightened will exercises over the desires,
but who at the same time gave free scope to the benevolent
affections, and a more religious and mystical
tone to the whole scheme of morals.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>“Plutarch, whose fame as a biographer has, I think,
unduly eclipsed his reputation as a moralist, may be
justly regarded as the leader of this movement, and
his moral writings may be profitably compared with
those of Seneca, the most ample exponent of the sterner
school. Seneca is not unfrequently self-conscious,
theatrical, and over-strained. His precepts have
something of the affected ring of a popular preacher.
The imperfect fusion of his short sentences gives his
style a disjointed and, so to speak, granulated character,
which the emperor Caligula happily expressed
when he compared it to sand without cement; yet he
often rises to a majesty of eloquence, a grandeur
both of thought and expression, that few moralists
have ever rivaled. Plutarch, though far less sublime,
is more sustained, equable and uniformly pleasing.
The Montaigne of antiquity, his genius coruscates
playfully and gracefully around his subject; he delights
in illustrations which are often singularly
vivid and original, but which by their excessive multiplication
appear sometimes rather the texture than
the ornament of his discourse. A gentle, tender spirit,
and a judgment equally free from paradox, exaggeration,
and excessive subtilty, are characteristics of all
he wrote. Plutarch excels most in collecting motives
of consolation; Seneca in forming characters that
need no consolation. There is something of the woman
in Plutarch; Seneca is all man.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c010'><sup>[4]</sup></a> The writings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>of the first resemble the strains of the flute, to which
the ancients attributed the power of calming the
possessions and chasing away the clouds of sorrow,
and drawing men by gentle suasion into the paths of
virtue; the writings of the other are like the trumpet
blast which kindles the soul with heroic courage. The
first is more fitted to console a mother sorrowing
over her dead child; the second to nerve a brave
man, without flinching and without illusion, to
grapple with an inevitable fate. The elaborate letters
which Seneca has left us on distinctive tenets of the
Stoical school, such as the equality of the vices, or
the evil of the affections, have now little more than
an historic interest; but the general tone of his
writings gives them a permanent importance, for they
reflect and foster a certain type of excellence which,
since the extinction of Stoicism, has had no adequate
expression in literature. The prevailing
moral tone of Plutarch, on the other hand, being
formed mainly on the prominence of the amiable
virtues has been eclipsed or transcended by the
Christian writers, but his definite contribution to
philosophy and morals are more important than
those of Seneca. He has left us one of the best
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>works on Superstition, and one of the most ingenious
on Providence, we possess. He was probably the first
writer who advocated very strongly humanity to animals
on the broad ground of universal benevolence,
as distinguished from the Pythagorean doctrine of
transmigration, as he was also remarkable, beyond all
his contemporaries for his high sense of female excellence,
and of the sanctity of female love.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Seneca, Plutarch, and the Apostle Paul were in a
sense contemporaries. All three did what they could
to make the world better in their time and after them.
All three were preachers of righteousness, each in his
way. All three wrote much that has engaged the
attention of the world, and stimulated its thought.
But how great the contrast between the projects of
these men, especially the two last! Plutarch was
wholly lacking in Paul’s devotion to an idea. He
would have scouted the suggestion that a man should
give up friends, social position, country, kindred,
everything, to go forth to preach a new doctrine.
How widely apart, how almost diametrically opposite
the methods of two men who are in a sense seeking
the same end! The thoughts of the philosopher, his
intellectual vision, was turned toward the setting sun.
At most he could only hope, as we now see, to prolong
the dim twilight that still hovered over the earth.
The world had well-nigh lost faith in the power of
human reason to regenerate mankind. The spiritual
eyes of the Christian were on the rising sun. Though
he saw that it was as yet shining but dimly, he had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>no doubt that in time it would rise to noonday splendor.
The pillar of fire that led and lighted the way for
the saint; the beatific vision that always stood before
his enraptured gaze; the world-embracing panorama
that kept growing larger and larger as the little
Christian colonies were planted one after another in
Asia Minor, in Greece, in Rome, had no existence
for the philosopher. He has, it is true, a belief in an
overruling Providence, but it lacks clearness, because
weakened by a polytheistic creed, or at least by the
remnants of such a creed. To it he still tenaciously
clings, though it may be half unconsciously. He too
had a belief in an existence after death; but it was
not of the sort that made him feel that all the tribulations
of this world which were but for a moment
were not to be compared with the glory that should
follow.</p>

<p class='c007'>If we would personify Christianity and Philosophy
as they met each other at the close of the first century
of our era, we may designate the one as the young
man, who, though poor in this world’s goods, is strong
in hope, in faith, in himself and in his cause. His
superb physique, his capital digestion, make him
ready for any enterprise, any sacrifice that shall
promise success. Any field in which he may display
his splendid energies is welcome to him, for he lives
not in the past, but in the future. The other is the
old man who has, in the main, lived a useful and
honorable life, who has performed some noble deeds,
and whose chief anxiety is to give the rising generation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>the benefit of the wisdom that has come to him
in a life of study and observation. But, as is usually
the case with the aged, his advice has become commonplace
and the rising generation passes him by
almost unheeded. Few have now any confidence in
his teachings, while many of his former disciples
have deserted him. It is his sad fate, to see himself
jostled at first and finally thrust aside by the passing
stream of humanity.</p>

The principal works used in the study of Plutarch
here placed before the reader are the following:</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Plutarchi Chaeronensis Moralia. Edidit Daniel Wyttenbach.
8 voll. Oxonii, 1795-1821.</i></p>

<p class='c003'><i>R. Volkmann. Leben und Schriften des Plutarch von Chaeronea.

<p class='c003'><i>O. Grèard. De la Morale de Plutarque. Cinquiéme edition. Paris,
1892.</i></p>

<p class='c003'><i>Plutarch’s Werke übersetzt von Klaiber, Bähr, u. A. Stuttgart,

<p class='c003'><i>Plutarchi Chaeronensis Moralia. Recognovit Gregorius N. Bernardakis.
Lipsiae, 1888-96. 7 voll.</i></p>

<p class='c009'>The last named contains a revised text only;
from it my translation of the De Sera was made.
The German translation of Bähr, the well-known
Heidelberg professor, in the collection above cited,
follows the original very closely and has been of
much service to me by its interpretation of obscure
passages.</p>

<p class='c007'>A complete catalogue of Plutarch’s Moralia is given
in the appendix. The list is borrowed from the
edition of Bernardakis and the question of authenticity
is not taken into account.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span><span class='sc'>Note</span>:—To translate Plutarch is a very different task from
that of translating Seneca. The style of the latter is terse and
epigrammatic; clauses and sentences often follow each other
without connectives, and are in the main short. That of the
former is the reverse. Most of his sentences are long, many
of them very long. These, as well as clauses and words, are
often strung together with the participles καὶ and γὰρ,
or other connectives, until the reader sometimes wonders
whether they will ever end. Seneca is full of pithy sayings
well suited for quotation; in Plutarch they are rare. The
style of both writers is highly rhetorical, but, if we except
the evident striving after effect, they have little else in common.</p>

<p class='c003'>As in the case of Seneca, it has been my aim to preserve for
the English reader the peculiarities of the Greek, so far as
possible. There is much to be said in favor of making a
translation, above everything else, readable; but in the effort
to do so, the translator is constantly exposed to the danger of
displacing the style of the original with his own. I hope I
have in a measure, at least, succeeded in putting before the
English reader, not only what Plutarch said in the following
Tract, but also how he said it.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>“Because sentence against an evil work is not executed
speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in
them to do evil.”</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chap8' class='c005'>CONCERNING THE DELAY OF THE DEITY IN PUNISHING THE WICKED.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>DRAMATIS PERSONAE.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Plutarch.</span> <span class='sc'>Patrocleas</span>, his son-in-law. <span class='sc'>Timon</span>, his brother.
<span class='sc'>Olympichus.</span></p>

<p class='c008'>The scene is the portico of the temple of Apollo at Delphi.
The tract is dedicated to a certain Quintus, whose name seems
to indicate that he was a Roman, but of whom nothing definite
is known.</p>

<p class='c009'>When Epicurus had thus spoken, O Quintus, and
before any one had replied, he went hurriedly away,
as we were now at the end of the porch. We stood for
some time in speechless wonder at the strange conduct
of the man and looking at one another, then
turned back to resume our walk. Thereupon Patrocleas
first broke the silence: “Pray, what shall we
do?” said he, “Shall we drop the inquiry, or shall
we answer the arguments of the speaker who is not
present as if he were?” “It would not be fitting to
leave the dart he discharged, as he departed, sticking
in the wound. Brasidas, as we are told, drew the
shaft from his body, and with the same weapon slew
the man who had hit him. It is not worth our while,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>of course, to defend ourselves against all those who
assail us with ill-grounded or fallacious arguments,
but it will suffice us if we cast them from us before
they become firmly fixed in our minds.” “What was
there then,” said I, “in what he said that most
impressed you? For many things and without any
order, one here, another there, the man kept charging
against Providence, with anger and vituperation at
the same time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Hereupon Patrocleas said: “The tardiness and
delay of the Deity in punishing the wicked seems to
me a matter of special importance; and now, by the
arguments that have been advanced, I have been led
anew and, as it were, a stranger, to the question; but
long ago I was offended when I read in Euripides,</p>

<p class='c007'>‘He procrastinates, and this is the manner of the
Deity.’ Yet God ought, least of all things, to be slack
towards the wicked, as they are neither slack nor dilatory
about doing evil, but are impelled by their unrestrained
passions to acts of injustice. And in truth,
the retribution, which Thucydides says follows close
upon the commission of a crime, forthwith bars the
way for those who usually prosper in successful villainy.
For there is no debt like overdue justice that
makes him who has been wronged so faint-hearted
and discouraged, while it emboldens the wicked man
in his audacity and violence; but the punishments that
follow close upon the commission of crimes are restraints
upon those who are meditating wrongs
against others, and there is the greatest consolation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>in this for those who have suffered injustice. So, then,
the remark of Bias often troubles me when I reflect
upon it; for he said, according to report, to a certain
reprobate, that he did not fear lest he might not suffer
the punishment of his misdeeds, but only that he
might not himself (Bias) live to see it. What profit
was it to the Messenians, who were long since dead,
that Aristokrates was punished for betraying them at
the battle of Taphros, when the matter remained undiscovered
for more than twenty years, during which
time he had been king of the Arcadians, though he
was finally detected and punished, when they were no
longer alive? Or what consolation was it to the
Orchomenians who had lost children and friends and
kinsmen through the treason of Lykiscus, that he
was seized a long time afterwards by a disease which
gradually ate up his body?—this man who was always
dipping his feet into the river to wet them and calling
down a curse upon himself, praying that he might rot
if he had betrayed and wronged them. And the casting
forth of the bodies of the accursed from Athens
and their transportation beyond the boundaries was
an act that not even the children of those who had
been slain were permitted to behold. Wherefore,
Euripides inappropriately uses these lines to deter
men from the commission of crime, ‘Fear not lest
injustice overtake thee and smite thee down, unjust
man; but in silence and with slow step it will overtake
the wicked when the time is ripe.’ For verily,
no other consideration but just such as these, the bad
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>will naturally use to encourage themselves and take
as pledges of security in villainy, on the ground that
wrong-doing brings forth early and evident fruit,
while the penalty comes late, and long after the satisfaction
(that arises from success in crime).”</p>

<p class='c007'>3. When Patrocleas had concluded his remarks,
Olympichus spoke up and said, “To what great absurdities
do the delays and postponements of the Deity
in such matters lead! Because this tardiness destroys
faith in Providence, and the fact that retribution does
not closely follow each particular act of wrong-doing
but is later, thus making room for chance, men, by
calling it a misfortune, not a penalty, are they in any
wise bettered? Even though they may be grieved at
what has befallen them, do they feel regret at what
they have done? For just as the immediate stroke
of the whip or the spur laid quickly to the horse that
makes a false step or stumbles brings it to a sense of
duty, but all the subsequent jerking and tugging at
the reins and shouting seem rather to be done for
some other reason than correction, because they
produce pain but not betterment; so vice, if lashed
and beaten for each act of villainy committed, would
speedily become repentant and humble and fearful of
God who beholds men’s acts and sufferings, if He did
not postpone justice. And justice that according to
Euripides procrastinates and with slow pace overtakes
the wicked, seems more like an affair of chance than
of Providence, because there is about it so much uncertainty,
delay and lack of system. The result is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>that I do not see what use there is in the saying that
the mills of the gods grind late, both because they obscure
justice and take away the fear of evil-doing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>4. Thereupon in reply to these remarks and while
I was still absorbed in reflection, Timon said: “Shall
I now add to the discussion the climax of my own
perplexity or shall I pass it over until after the disposal
of the main argument?” “What is the use,”
said I, “of sending along a third wave to wash away
the subject-matter, if it be found impossible to refute
and invalidate the first objection? First, then,
beginning, as we say, at the ingle-side and with the
caution of the philosophers of the Academy in regard
to the divinity, let us beware of assuming that we
know just what to say on this subject. In truth, an
affair of more serious moment is the consideration of
supernal and divine things, for us who are human beings,
than when one who has no ear for music discusses
this art, or when one who has never served in
the army discourses on military affairs; because,
though ignorant of the plan of the artificer, we assume
to be able to fathom his designs from what we
suppose to be probable and fitting. It is not hard for
one unacquainted with the healing art to comprehend
the reasoning of a physician as to why he did not
sooner perform a certain amputation rather than later,
or why he ordered a bath yesterday and not to-day;
in respect to God, on the other hand, it is not easy for
a mortal to say any thing positive except that, knowing
best the proper occasion for curing a man of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>vices, He administers to each person chastisements
as medicaments, but not equally severe in all cases
nor at one and the same time. For that the healing
art when applied to the soul is called right and righteousness
and is the greatest of all arts, Pindar in addition
to thousands of others, affirms, when he calls God
the ruler and custodian of the whole universe, the
‘master builder,’ for the reason that He is the guardian
of justice according to which it shall be determined
when and how and to what degree every
wicked man is to be punished. And of this art Plato
says that Minos the son of Jove was a student, as it
is not possible to properly dispense justice, or to
recognize what is just unless one has learned and
acquired a knowledge of the same. Not even the
laws that men enact have always their clear and
plain justification and some enactments even seem at
first sight ridiculous. For instance, in Lacedaemon,
the ephors, immediately upon taking office, issue an
edict that no one is to wear a mustache and that
the laws are to be obeyed in order that none may feel
their severity. The Romans inflict a slight blow
with a twig upon those whom they intend to emancipate;
and when they make a will they bequeath their
property to some persons as their heirs, but sell it to
others,—which seems to be absurd. But most absurd one
would think the law of Solon to be to the effect that
he shall be deprived of civil rights, who, when there
are parties and factions in the state, take sides with
neither. In short, one could name many anomalies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>in law, if he did not know the intentions of the law-maker,
and did not understand the reason for every
single part of the decrees that have been issued.
What wonder is it then, if, when it is so hard to see
through human purposes, that it is not easy to say
with respect to the gods for what reason they punish
some transgressors later, others sooner.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. These things are no excuse for shunning an investigation,
but a plea for indulgence, so that the
discussion, looking as it were, toward a harbor and
port of refuge, may move forward with the greater
confidence, in the midst of perplexities. Then consider
first this fact, that according to Plato, God
having placed Himself in the midst of all that is enchantingly
fair, as a sort of model, gives to human
worth, which is in some measure an image of Himself,
an exemplar which all are to follow so far as
they are able. For the universe, being in its natural
state devoid of order, began to change and to be
transformed into a cosmos when it participated in,
and became assimilated to, the divine idea and virtue.
This same man also says that nature kindles in
us the germ of vision so that by beholding the
heavenly bodies borne along in their courses, and by
admiration of the same, the soul becomes habituated
to take pleasure in and to love what is orderly
and systematically arranged, but that it hates all disorderly
and uncontrolled passion, and shuns the
purposeless and hit-or-miss as being the origin of all
vice and discord. It is impossible for man, by his very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>nature, to have a completer enjoyment of God than
when seeking and earnestly striving after virtue by
imitating everything that is good and noble. For
this reason also God punishes the wicked in due time
and with deliberation; not because He is Himself
afraid of making a mistake by chastising any one too
soon or because He might repent of it, but in order
to remove from us what is brutal and hasty in the infliction
of punishment, and to teach us not to chastise
in anger nor when greatly excited and indignant,
‘rage o’erleaps the bounds of reason’; as if, in order
to satisfy our hunger or quench our thirst we
rushed upon those who have done us an injury, but
imitating His goodness and long-suffering and taking
time as our adviser, that gives least room for repentance,
we should proceed to inflict punishments in
accordance with justice. For, as Socrates said, it is
less mischievous to drink murky water, heedlessly,
than when one is in a perturbed state of mind and
under the influence of anger and has lost the power
of self-control before the mind has become calm
and clear, to vent one’s wrath on the person of a
kinsman or friend. For vengeance does not belong
close upon the inquiry, as Thucydides says, but is
most in place when as far from it as possible. Since
anger, according to Melanthius ‘commits terrible
deeds when it has displaced self-control’; so, likewise,
reason does what is just and fitting when it has
put aside anger and excitement. Further also, men
are made humane by the example of others when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>they learn, for instance, that Plato, after raising his
staff to strike his slave, remained standing for a long
time, as he himself says, in this way chastening his
anger. And Archytas, on learning that his servants
were negligent and disorderly in his fields, but
noticing that he was greatly angered and incensed
at them, did nothing but remark as he walked away,
‘You are lucky that I am very wroth at you.’ If,
therefore, the reported sayings of men, treasured up
for us, deter us from harshness and the violence
resulting from passion; much more does it become us,
as we look upon God who lacks nothing and who
knows no repentance for any deed, yet postpones
punishment to the future and bides His time, to be
on our guard in such matters. We ought also to
look upon mildness and long-suffering as the divine
part of the virtue which God Himself exemplifies
(in His dealings with men), and to remember that
few are made better by swift chastisement, but that
many are profited and admonished by tardiness in
punishing.</p>

<p class='c007'>6. In the second place, let us remember that
punishments among men, having regard solely to the
infliction of injuries to others, cease with the
malefactor and go no further; therefore, like a
barking dog they (the penalties) cling to the heels
of the transgression and follow up actions closely.
But God, as seems reasonable, discerns the passions
of the diseased soul upon which He wishes to
visit punishment, whether in any way, perchance, it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>may turn to repentance, and He gives time for amendment
to those whose vices are not ineradicable and
incurable. For, knowing (as He does) what portion
of virtue souls going forth from Him to be born,
carry with them, and how strong and ineffaceable is
the nobleness implanted in them, and that virtue
yields to vice contrary to its nature because corrupted
by food and evil communications, and that some, after
undergoing a cure, again resume their former nature,
He does not inflict upon all a penalty equally severe.
But him who is incorrigible He removes forthwith
from life and cuts off, because constant association
with wickedness is very harmful to others, and in the
highest degree harmful to the soul itself. On the
contrary, to those who from ignorance of the good
rather than from a predilection for evil and to whom
it is only second nature to go astray, He gives time
for repentance. But if they remain obdurate He visits
these also with punishment, for, of course, He has
no fear lest they may escape Him. Consider also
what transformations have taken place in the character
of men and in their life; for which reason also
this change and character (ἦθος) is called a turning
(τρόπος) as habit (ἔθος) for the most part shapes it
and by laying hold of it controls it. I think, therefore,
that the ancients represented Kecrops dual in
form (a combination of man and dragon), not as
some say, because, after he had been an excellent
king he became a cruel and ruthless tyrant, but for
the opposite reason, namely, that after having been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>unjust and merciless he turned out to be gentle and
kindly, when he had got into power. If this is not
certain, we know, at least, that Gelo and Hiero, both
Sicilians, and Peisistratus the son of Hippokrates,
all men who had put themselves at the head of affairs
by base methods, used their power for the furtherance
of virtuous ends; and though they had attained
power illegally, they nevertheless became just
and popular rulers. They promoted good order and
the cultivation of the soil; made temperate and industrious
citizens out of men who had been gossipers
and idlers; and Gelo, after fighting bravely and defeating
the Carthaginians in a great battle, would not
make the peace with them which they sued for until
they had pledged themselves to cease from sacrificing
their children to Kronos. In Megalopolis, Lydiades
was a usurper; but when at the height of his
power a change came over him and, having conceived
a loathing for iniquity, he gave a constitution to the
citizens, then in a battle with the enemies of his
country met a glorious death. If some one had slain
the usurper Miltiades in the Chersonesus, or had
prosecuted Kimon for incest with his sister, or had
driven Themistocles from the city by an indictment,
when he was indulging in drunken revelries and insulting
people in the market place, as was afterwards
done with Alkibiades, would we not have lost the
heroes of Marathon, of the Eurymedon and fair
Artemisium, ‘where the sons of the Athenians laid the
glorious corner-stone of liberty?’ Men cast in a large
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>mold neither do anything in a small way, nor do the
vehemence and energy of their titanic natures suffer
them to be inactive; but they are tossed to and fro
like a ship on the waves until they settle down into a
fixed and well-grounded character. Just as a person
who was ignorant of agriculture would not take a
fancy to land, if he saw it overgrown with weeds and
brambles, full of wild animals, running water and
marshes; while to one who has learned to discriminate
and to judge, these very things show the strength and
goodness of the soil; so men cast in a large mold commit
irregularities and follies—men whose volcanic
and vehement natures we cannot endure, and think
they ought to be cut off or kept in check. But the
better judge, he who in spite of these things discerns
innate worth and nobility, waits until age and maturity
become the co-workers of reason and virtue, when
nature shall bring forth her proper fruit.”</p>

<p class='c007'>7. “So much, then, on this point. And do you
not think certain of the Greeks have done wisely in
adopting the Egyptian law that forbids the execution
of a woman condemned to death during pregnancy,
until after her delivery?” “Most assuredly,” they
said. “If then,” said I, “a person is big, not with a
child, but with a deed or a secret project which he
may in the course of time bring into the world and
put into execution, or if he might disclose some
hidden crime, or be the author of some judicious
counsel or the discoverer of some useful invention,
would it not be better to await a seasonable time for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>removing him (than to do it prematurely)? To me
at least it seems so,” I said. “And to us also,” replied
Patrocleas. “Very good,” said I. “Now consider
that if Dionysius had been punished at the beginning
of his usurped power, no Greek would have
settled in Sicily, though it had been laid waste by
the Carthaginians; nor would Greeks have settled in
Apollonia or in Anaktorium or in the peninsula of
Leukadia, if Periander had not received his punishment
a long time after (his accession to power).
And I believe also that the day of reckoning for
Kasander was postponed in order that Thebes might
be rebuilt. Of the mercenaries that had assisted in
plundering the temple here the greater part accompanied
Timoleon on an expedition to Sicily where
they conquered the Carthaginians and overthrew the
tyrants; then the miserable wretches died a miserable
death. There is no doubt that the Deity sometimes
employs certain men after the manner of public executioners,
to be the avengers of other villains, then
destroys them as I think He does most tyrants. For
just as the gall of the hyena and the beestings (or
rennet) of the seal and other parts of repulsive animals
have a property that is useful for the cure of diseases,
so God inflicts on some persons who need a drastic
remedy and chastisement, a stern and hard tyrant;
nor does He release them from their grievous and
melancholy state until He has cured their disease and
purified them. Such a medicine was Phalaris to the
Akragantines, and to the Romans, Marius. To the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>Sikyonians also the god declared explicitly that their
city needed a scourge for taking away from the
Kleonians the boy Teletias, crowned in the Pythian
games, as their own fellow-citizen, and putting him
to death. So, sure enough, when Orthagoras had become
tyrant of Sikyon, and after him Myron and
Kleisthenes, he and his successors made an end of
their lasciviousness; the Kleonians, however, not receiving
such curative treatment, sank into insignificance.
You know that Homer somewhere says, ‘From
him, a far baser father, was born a son better in all
manner of excellence’; yet that son of Kopreus performed
no brilliant or even noteworthy exploit. But
the descendants of Sisyphus and of Autolycus and
of Phlegyas were conspicuous for the deeds and virtues
of great kings. Pericles of Athens, also sprang
from a house on which rested a curse; while in Rome,
Pompey the Great was the son of Strabo whose
corpse the Roman people, in their hatred, cast out
and trampled under foot. Why should it then be
thought strange, if, just as the husbandman does not
dig up the thorns lest he destroy the asparagus, and
the Lydians do not burn the shrub until they have
gathered the gum from it; so God should in like manner
delay to extirpate the evil and corrupt root of an
illustrious and kingly house until the proper fruit has
grown from it? It was better for the Phokians to
lose the countless herds of kine and horses belonging
to Iphitus, as also that much gold and silver should
be taken from Delphi, than not to have had Ulysses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>or Asklepias born among them, or the other distinguished
and noble-minded men whose ancestors had
been evil-doers and reprobates.</p>

<p class='c007'>8. Do you not think it better that retribution
should come in due season and in a fitting way, than
immediately and all at once? As, for instance, in
the case of Kalippus, who, supposed to be the friend
of Dion, killed him with the same sword with which
he was afterward dispatched by his friends; and that
of Mitias the Argive who had been slain in a tumult
and whose brazen statue in the market-place fell on
the slayer of Mitias during a dramatic performance
and killed him. And the stories of Bessus, the
Paeonian, and of Aristo the Oetaean, the leaders of
the mercenaries, you, of course, know, Patrocleas.”
“I do not,” said he, “but I would like to hear them.”
“Aristo,” I said, “having taken away the ornaments
of Eriphyle lying here (in this temple), with the
permission of the authorities, presented them to his
wife; but his son, angered at his mother from some
cause, set the house on fire and burned up all who
were in it. And Bessus, as the story goes, having
killed his own father, was not found out for a long
time, but finally, going to a banquet with some
friends and happening to strike a nest of young
swallows with his spear, knocked it down and killed
the fledglings. When those who were present said,
as was natural, ‘Man, what possessed you to do such
an ill-omened deed?’ he replied, ‘Have they not this
long time been falsely accusing me and crying out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>against me for killing my father’? The astonished
company reported the remark to the king, and after
the case had been investigated Bessus received his
just deserts.”</p>

<p class='c007'>9. “We say these things,” I continued, “on the
assumption that there is a postponement of punishment
for the wicked; on the other hand, it is proper
to hear what Hesiod says, who does not think with
Plato that punishment is a pain which follows injustice,
but that it is something of equal age with it; that
it springs from the same root and place, for he says,</p>

<p class='c007'>‘Evil counsel is most hurtful to him who has given
it,’ and,</p>

<p class='c007'>‘He who lays plots for another, lays a plot against
himself.’</p>

<p class='c007'>The cantharis, you know, is said to contain within
itself the antidote (for the pain it inflicts), and villainy,
by engendering within itself both pain and
punishment, pays the penalty for evil-doing, not at a
subsequent time, but in the outrage itself. Every
malefactor who is punished by the infliction of pain
on his body bears his own cross, and vice wreaks upon
itself, out of itself, its own vengeance, because it is in
a sense a creator of the woes of life that it brings into
existence, together with the accompanying disgrace,
many sorrows, fears and violent passions and regrets
and unceasing restlessness. Some people are in no
wise different from children, who, on seeing malefactors
in the theaters often clad in gilded and purple
garments, crowned and dancing about, are delighted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>and admire them as fortunate mortals, until they are
seen goaded and scourged, while the fire breaks forth
from their splendid and costly attire. For many of
the wicked are the owners of fine mansions, and, as
they hold magistracies and other responsible positions,
no one is aware that they are undergoing punishment
until they are put to death or hurled from
rocks. This, one ought not to call punishment, but
the consummation and fulfilment of punishment.
For as Herodicus of Selymbria, who had been attacked
by consumption, an incurable disease, was the
first to combine gymnastics with the healing art, and
of whom Plato says, that (in so doing) he protracted
his own death, and that of all who were similarly
diseased; so malefactors who are seen to have escaped
immediate punishment, expiate their crimes by a
longer, not by a shorter penalty; nor after a longer
time but during a longer time; they are not punished
after they have grown old, but they grow old during
their punishment. And I say <i>a long time</i> with reference
to ourselves, for to the gods the span of human
life is nothing,—now, but not thirty years ago is the
same as to say, that in the evening, but not in the
morning, the malefactor, is to be tortured or hanged,
especially since man is shut up in this life just as in
a prison from which there is no migration to another
place or escape, but which in the meanwhile allows
time for many enjoyments and the transaction of
business, the bestowing and receiving of honors and
favors, and for diversions; just as persons in prison
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>are allowed to play at dice or draughts, though the
noose is all the while dangling above their heads.</p>

<p class='c007'>10. Moreover, what reason is there for saying
that those who lie in prison under sentence of death
do not receive their punishment until they are decapitated?
or that he who has drunk the hemlock-juice,
but is still walking about waiting for the heaviness
to get into his legs, until he is seized by anaesthesia
and the rigor of death, (has not received his?)
If we regard the consummation of the punishment as
the punishment itself, we overlook the intervening
sufferings and fears, as well as the apprehension and
regret with which every evil-doer is harassed. Is not
this just as if we were to say of the fish that has swallowed
the hook, that it is not caught until we see it
broiled or cut up by the cooks? Every one who has
committed a crime is firmly held by justice and has
then and there fastened within himself, like a bait
the sweet morsel of iniquity. Having an avenging
conscience in his breast, ‘Like a frantic tunny he
spins round in the sea.’ For the well-known reckless
audacity and over-confidence of vice is active and
ardent until the evil deed has been done; then the
passion subsiding like a wind, sinks down weak and
cowed under the weight of fears and superstitions; so
that it is entirely in accordance with the event and
the truth that Stesichorus attributes a dream to
Klytemnestra in about these words: ‘She thought a
dragon with gory head approached her, and from it
Pleisthenades came forth.’ For visions by night and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>apparitions by day and oracles and celestial portents
and whatever other phenomenon is regarded as
caused by the direct interposition of God, cause
anxieties and fears to persons who have a guilty
conscience. For example, it is said, that Apollodorus
once in a dream saw himself flayed by the Scythians,
then boiled, and heard his heart speaking from the
caldron and saying, ‘I am the cause of all this’; and
that at another time he saw his daughters all ablaze,
their bodies encircled with flame, running about him.
Hipparchus also, the son of Peisistratus, a little
before his death saw Aphrodite flinging blood in his
face from a kind of basin; and the favorites of
Ptolemy the Thunderer, saw him summoned before a
tribunal by Seleucus where vultures and wolves were
the judges, distributing many pieces of flesh among
his enemies. Pausanias, likewise, having caused a
free maiden to be brought by force from Byzantium
in order to pass the night with her, but when she was
come, owing to some perturbation of mind and
suspicion, had her put to death—this maiden he frequently
saw in a dream calling to him, ‘Hasten to
judgment; assuredly lust brings sorrow on men.’ As
the apparition did not cease to haunt him, it is said
that he set sail for the oracle of the dead at Heracleia
where he called up the ghost of the damsel by expiatory
rites and libations. Appearing before him,
she said that he would be freed from his troubles
when he came to Lacedaemon; but as soon as he
arrived there he died.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>11. If then the soul has no sensation after death,
and dissolution is the end of all rewards and punishments,
one might rather say that the divinity deals
kindly and indulgently with the wicked who are
speedily chastised and die. For if we were to assert
nothing more than that as long as they live and
during the present existence no evil befalls the bad,
but that when vice is exposed and is seen to be a
fruitless and barren thing, that it brings nothing
good or worth an effort, in spite of many severe
agonies of mind—the recognition of these facts renders
life an uneasy one. A case in point is the story
told of Lysimachus that under stress of thirst he
gave up his body and his dominions to the Getae,
but that when he had got into their hands and received
a draught he cried out, ‘Shame on my baseness
for depriving myself of such a kingdom for so
short-lived a pleasure.’ Yet it is exceedingly difficult
to resist the needs of our physical nature; but
when a man, either for the sake of money or from
avidity for political honors or influence, commits a
lawless and wicked act, and when, after the thirst and
madness of his passion have been allayed, he finds,
in the course of time, that the ignominy and the bitter
sorrow for his crimes remain behind, and that
villainy has been neither advantageous nor necessary
nor profitable, must not the thought, so servile and
mean, often occur to him, that for empty glory or
fleeting enjoyment he has trampled under foot the
dearest and highest rights of mankind, only to fill his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>life with shame and confusion. For as Simonides
jestingly said, that he always found the chest he
kept for money full and the one he kept for gratitude
empty; so wicked men, when they examine their
own evil hearts, discover that for the sake of a pleasure
which directly proves to be an empty one, they
find them void of hope but full of sorrows and pain,
unpleasant memories, and anxiety for the future,
but big with distrust of the present. Just as we
hear Ino crying out in the theater when filled
with regret for what she had done, ‘Dear women,
how can I again dwell in the house of Athamas?
Would that I had done none of the deeds I committed!’
So the soul of every villain ought to consider
well and reflect how it may rid itself of the memory
of its iniquities and exorcise a bad conscience, undergo
a process of purification and live life over again.
When the bad is deliberately preferred, it shows a
lack of confidence and firmness and strength and
stability—unless, forsooth, we admit that evil-doers
are a class of sages. Wherever there exists an uncontrollable
love of money and pleasure, and insatiable
avarice coupled with malice or a bad character,
there you will find also, if you look closely, latent
superstitions and an aversion to labor and fear of
death and sudden gusts of passion and an eagerness
to be talked about joined to a penchant for boasting.
Such men fear those who censure them and are afraid
of those who praise them as persons who have been
wronged by deception; they are particularly hostile
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>to the wicked because they freely praise those who
have the reputation of being virtuous. For that
which hardens men in vice is like the brittleness in
poor iron and is easily shivered. Whence it comes
that as they, in the course of time, gain a deeper insight
into the nature of things, are weighed down
with sorrow and become morose and abhor their own
past life. It surely cannot be but that a bad man
who has restored a trust, or become surety for a friend,
or who from a love of glory or fame has given and
contributed something to his country, will forthwith
regret what he has done, because he is unstable in
his ways and fickle in his purpose; sometimes persons
of this kind, even when applauded in the theaters,
groan inwardly because the love of money has supplanted
the love of glory; nor can it be that those
who have sacrificed men for the attainment of sovereignty
or to carry out a conspiracy, as did Apollodorus,
or who have taken away money from their
friends, as did Glaucus, do not repent, nor hate themselves,
and do not feel regret for what they have done.
I, for my part, do not believe, if I may say so, that
there is need of any god or man to punish the impious,
but that their life, ruined and made uneasy by
vice, is fully sufficient.”</p>

<p class='c007'>12. “Consider, however,” I said, “whether we are
not examining the argument at greater length than
its importance demands.” To this Timon replied,
“It may be, in view of what is yet to come and of
what has been omitted. For I shall now bring up as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>a sort of reserve the final difficulty, since we have in
a measure worked our way through those that preceded.
What Euripides alleges against the gods
when he boldly charges them with turning ‘the transgressions
of the parents over to their children,’ this,
believe me, we also tacitly impute to them as an injustice.
For, if those who have committed offenses
have themselves expiated them, there is no further
need of punishing those who have committed none,
since it is not just to punish a second time for the
same crime those who are innocent; or if through
negligence they have failed to punish the real criminals,
and long after visit the penalty upon the innocent,
they do not justly make up for their tardiness
by injustice. Something of this kind is told of
Aesop who, it is said, came here (to Delphi) with
gold from Crœsus in order to make a magnificent oblation
to the god and to distribute to each of the
Delphians four minae; but some difficulty arising, as
it seems, and he having got into a quarrel with the
parties here, performed the sacrifice but sent the
money back to Sardis, alleging that the men were not
worthy to receive it; thereupon they trumped up a
charge of temple-robbery against him and put him to
death by hurling him from the rock called Hyampeia.
For this the god is said to have become incensed at
them and to have sent a famine upon the land,
together with all manner of strange diseases; so that
they went around to the Hellenic festivals proclaiming
and making known everywhere that whoever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>wished might wreak vengeance upon them for the
wrong they had done to Aesop. In the third generation
came one Iadmon, a man in no way related to
Aesop, but a descendant of those who had bought
him in Samos; and to this man, having in some way
made satisfaction (for the wrong done to Aesop), the
Delphians were released from their calamities.
After that date also, they say, the punishment of
temple-robbery was transferred to Nauplia from
Hyampeia. Those who are great admirers of Alexander,
of which number we also are, do not commend
him for destroying the city of the Branchidae and
putting them all to death, without distinction of age
or sex, because their forefathers had betrayed the
temple at Miletus. Agathocles, too, the usurper of
Syracuse, mockingly told the Corcyreans, in answer
to the question why he had laid waste their island,
‘That it most assuredly was because their fathers had
kindly received Ulysses.’ To the people of Ithaca he
likewise replied when they expostulated with him because
his soldiers carried off their sheep, ‘Your king
also came to us and even blinded the shepherd.’ And
is not Apollo even more unreasonable if he is destroying
the present generation of Pheneatae by blocking
up the barathrum and inundating their entire territory,
because a thousand years ago, as they say, Hercules
carried off the prophetic tripod and took it to Pheneus?
or when he foretold to the Sybarites a release
from their ills, whenever they had appeased the
anger of the Leucadian Hera, by a demolition three
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>times repeated? And in truth, it is not long since
the Lacedaemonians ceased to send virgins to Troy
‘who without upper garments and with bare feet,
like slaves, at early dawn swept around the altar of
Athena, without the wimple, even though old age
bore heavy upon them,’ on account of the lasciviousness
of Ajax. Where, pray, is the logic or justice
of these things? We do not approve the custom of
the Thracians, who even at the present day tattoo
their wives for the purpose of avenging Orpheus,
nor that of the barbarians along the Po for wearing
black garments in token of mourning for Pentheus,
as they say. And it would have been still more ridiculous,
I think, if the men who lived at the time
when Phaethon perished had not concerned themselves
about him, but those who were born five or ten
generations after his death had begun to change
their garments for his sake and to put on mourning.
Nevertheless this is merely silly and has nothing
pernicious or irremediable about it. But with what
reason does the anger of the gods sometimes suddenly
disappear like certain rivers, only to break out
afterwards against others in order to plunge them
into the direst misfortunes?”</p>

<p class='c007'>13. As soon as he ceased, I, fearing lest he might
again proceed anew to more and greater absurdities,
spoke up and asked him: “Very well, but do you accept
all these things as true?” To which he replied,
“Even if not all, but only some of them are true, do
you not think the question presents the same difficulty?”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>“Perhaps,” said I, “and yet when persons
are suffering from a high fever, the same or nearly
the same heat remains whether they have on them
one or more garments; nevertheless it affords some
relief (to the patient) to remove what is superfluous.
Still, if you do not wish to go on, we will let this matter
pass; at any rate, these stories look like fables
and inventions; remember, however, the festival
of Theoxenia, recently celebrated, and the honorable
place the heralds assign to the descendants of Pindar;
how imposing and delightful the ceremony appeared
to you. Who would not, I said, be charmed with the
bestowal of this honor, so entirely in harmony with
the spirit of Greek antiquity, unless his ‘black heart
had been forged with cold flame,’ to use one of Pindar’s
own expressions? Then I forbear to mention, I
said, a proclamation similar to this in Sparta called,
After the Lesbian Bard, in honor and memory of
Terpander the Ancient, for the argument is the
same. And you too, descendants of Opheltas, forsooth,
claim somewhat more consideration than
others among the Boeotians and at the hands of the
Phokians because of Diophantus; besides, you were
present and were the first to support me when I upheld
the traditional honor of Herakles and the right
to wear a crown which the Lycormae and the Satilaiae
laid claim to; for I said it was altogether proper
that the descendants of Herakles should enjoy unimpaired
honors and benefits for services which he had
rendered to the Greeks, but for which he had not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>himself received adequate recognition and requital.”
“You have recalled to my mind a noble contest,” he
said, “and one well worthy of a philosopher.” “Retract,
then, my friend,” said I, “this serious charge,
and do not take it ill if the descendants of wicked or
base men are sometimes punished; or cease to speak
with approval of the honors conferred upon those
who are of noble ancestry. For it is incumbent
upon us, if we are to requite to their descendants,
the services of their forefathers, as a matter of consistency
not to think that punishment ought to
cease or be discontinued at once after the crime,
but that it ought to run along with it and render a
recompense corresponding to it. He who is pleased
to see the family Kimon honored at Athens, but
feels sore and aggrieved when the descendants of
Lachares or Aristo are expelled, is very weak and inconsistent;
or rather, he is captious and hypercritical
as regards the deity: for he finds fault if the grand-children
of a wicked and unjust man seem to meet
with good fortune, and he finds fault again, if the
offspring of the vicious are cut off and blotted out.
He blames God equally whether the children of a
good man or a bad man fare ill.”</p>

<p class='c007'>14. “Let these things,” I said, “serve you as a sort
of bulwark against those over hasty and carping critics;
but let us take up again, as one may say, the beginning
of the thread of this obscure problem concerning
the Deity, with its many windings and ramifications,
and let us follow them up with care but without fear,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>to what is probable as well as what is reasonable;
this at least is clear and well established, that even in
those things which we ourselves do, we cannot always
give the reason. For example, why do we
direct the children of those who have died of consumption
or dropsy to sit with both feet in the
water until the corpse is buried? for it is believed
that in this way the disease will not pass to them or
come near them. Again, for what reason does a
whole herd of goats stand still if one of their number
gets eryngo in its mouth, until the herdsman comes
up and takes it out? And there are other forces in
nature that interact among each other and pass back
and forth with incredible swiftness through a great extent
of space. Yet we are surprised at intervals of
time, but not those of space. With all that, it is
more wonderful if Athens is infected with a disease
that had its origin in Ethiopia and of which Pericles
died and from which Thucydides suffered than if the
penalty for the crimes committed by the Delphians or
Sybarites should be carried down to and visited upon
their children. The forces of nature have certain
connections, and inter-relations with each other extending
from their farthest endings to their very beginnings,
the cause of which, though unknown by us,
silently produce their proper effects.</p>

<p class='c007'>15. And, in truth, the wrath of the gods, when it
falls upon a whole city, has its justification. For a city
is a unit and an entirety, just like an animal, that
does not lose its identity with the passing of the years,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>nor is transformed from one thing into something
different in the course of time, but is always affected
by like feelings and has a character peculiar to itself.
It merits all the praise and all the blame for what it
has done in its sovereign capacity, so long as the
community which makes it one and binds it together
preserves its unity. To make one city, in the course
of time, consist of many cities, or rather, of a countless
number, is like dividing one man into many because
he is now older, but was formerly younger, and
still earlier, a stripling. This is altogether like the
well-known argument of Epicharmus, the so-called
increasing syllogism, much used by the Sophists,
that the man who had incurred a debt some time ago
does not owe it now as he has become another man,
and that he who was invited to a banquet yesterday
comes to-day an unbidden guest because he is another
person. Advancing age produces greater changes in
each one of us than in the general character of cities.
Any one would recognize Athens if he saw it thirty
years ago; the customs of to-day, the motions, the
sports, the occupations, the likes and dislikes of the
people are precisely the same they were in former
times; but a man whom a relative or a friend might
chance to meet after an interval of time, he would
scarcely recognize, and the change of character easily
seen in every remark and occupation and in the feelings
and habits have, even for those who are about us
all the time, something strange and striking by their
novelty. Nevertheless a man is regarded as one person
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>from his birth to his death; and in like manner we
think it right that the city, which remains the same,
ought to be held responsible for the transgressions of
its former citizens with the same show of reason that
it shares in their glory and prestige; otherwise we
shall, without being aware of it, cast everything into
the river of Heracleitus into which he says nothing
goes twice because nature keeps all things in motion
and changes their form.</p>

<p class='c007'>16. If then a city is a unit and a continuous thing,
the same is undoubtedly true of the family that
springs from one and the same beginning and engenders
a certain power and a natural bond of sympathy
between all its members. That which is begotten
is not as if it were the handiwork of an artisan,
separate from him who begets, for it is something
that proceeds out of him, not something framed by
him; consequently it possesses and bears within
itself some portion of its original that may rightfully
be chastised or honored. If I were not afraid I
should be thought to be jesting I would say that the
statue of Kasander has suffered a greater wrong at
the hands of the Athenians when it was melted down,
and the body of Dionysius when after death it was
carried beyond their boundary by the Syracusans,
than their descendants in paying the penalty for the
deeds of these men. For in a statue of Kasander
there was no part of him, and the soul of Dionysius
had left the dead body long previously; but in the
case of Nysaeus and of Apollokrates and of Antipater
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>and of Philip and of all other persons in like
manner who are the children of vicious parents,
nature has implanted this predominant principle and
it is ever present with them; is not dormant or inoperative,
but they live in it and are nurtured by it;
with them it abides and it directs their actions. It is
not cruel or unreasonable if the children of these
men share their destiny. All things considered, here,
as in the healing art, what is advantageous is just,
and he would make himself ridiculous who should
affirm that in diseases of the hip-joint it was wrong
to cauterize the thumb, and in the case of an ulcerated
liver, to make an incision in the belly, and to
anoint the tips of the horns of cattle if their hoofs
are soft. So in the matter of punishments; he who
thinks anything else is just than what will cure vice,
and is scandalized if the healing is affected on one party
for the sake of another,—like the opening of a vein to
relieve the eyes—evidently sees no farther than what
is plain to the senses. He does not take into account
that even a schoolmaster, when he punishes
one pupil also corrects others, and that a general
who decimates his army punishes all his soldiers.
Likewise, certain qualities, good as well as bad,
are transmitted not only from one body to another,
but even more readily from one soul to another.
For in the one case it seems reasonable that
the same conditions should also produce the same
change, while in the other, the soul impelled by
motives and impulses is naturally inclined by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>boldness or timidity to become worse or better.”</p>

<p class='c007'>17. While I was yet speaking, Olympichus interrupting
me, said, “You seem, in your discourse, to
proceed on a weighty assumption, namely, the continued
existence of the soul.” “You will surely
grant this,” I replied, “or rather, have granted it,
for my argument has proceeded from the beginning
on the hypothesis that God distributes to us all
rewards and punishments according to our deserts.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hereupon he replied, “Do you then think it follows
of necessity, from the fact that because the gods
observe all our actions, and apportion rewards and
punishments, that souls are either altogether incorruptible,
or that they continue to exist for some time
after death?” “My good friends,” said I, “God is
not impatient, or so occupied with trifles, that if there
were not something of the divinity in us, something
at least in a measure similar to Himself, but if, like
unto leaves, as Homer says, we are altogether transitory,
and doomed to perish in a little while, He would
treat us with so much consideration—like those
women who plant the gardens of Adonis in fragments
of pottery and bestow pains on them—cherishing
those ephemeral souls of ours, that dwell in a
frail body, and when they are sprung up have no
firm root in life, but are forever extinguished by any
sudden calamity. But if you are agreed, let us pass
over the other gods and let us consider ours here (in
Delphi), whether you think, if he were aware that
the souls of those who have passed from life, forthwith
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>dissolve into nothing, like clouds or smoke, as
soon as they leave the body, he would have instituted so
many ceremonies for the dead, and would still require
large gifts and honors for the deceased, merely to
impose upon and delude the credulous. For my
part, I could never give up (my faith in) the
immortality of the soul unless some one should again,
like another Herakles, take away the tripod of the
Pythia, and eradicate and destroy the oracle. So long
as even in our day many such oracular responses are
rendered, as they say were given to Korax the Naxian,
it is impious to assert that the soul can die.” Here
Patrocleas asked, “What was the response and who
was this Korax? for to me both the name and the
circumstance are unknown.” “Not at all,” said I,
“but I am to blame for using a cognomen instead
of a name. The man who slew Archilochus in battle
was called Kalondas, as you know; but he bore the
eponym, Korax. Repelled at first by the Pythia for
killing a devotee of the Muses, he next had recourse
to prayers and humble supplications in order to secure
his restoration to favor, then was commanded to repair
to the habitation of Tettix, in order to appease the
soul of Archilochus. This was at Taenarus, for
thither, they say, Tettix the Cretan came with his
fleet, founded a city and settled near an oracle of the
dead. In like manner, also, an oracle came to the
Spartans, bidding them conciliate the soul of Pausanias,
persons who could evoke the dead having been
sent for to Italy; these, after offering sacrifice,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>conjured up the ghost of the dead man in the temple.</p>

<p class='c007'>18. This, then is one argument which establishes
the providence of God and at the same time the
immortality of the soul, and it is not possible to
reject the one and accept the other. Now if the soul
survives after the death of the body, it is also quite
reasonable that it shares the rewards and punishments
(of the latter). For in this life it is engaged
in a contest, like an athlete, and when the contest is
ended it receives its deserts. To the rewards and
punishments meted out when existing there by itself
(separate from the body) for the deeds of the previous
life, the living attach no importance; they are
concealed from our knowledge, and discredited. But
those that are transmitted to children and through
successive generations, being plainly evident to all
who live here, turn many bad men from their ways
and hold them in check. There is no more grievous
chastisement, and none that reaches more to the quick,
than for men to see their descendants in misfortune
on their account; and when the soul of an impious
and unjust man beholds, after death, not statues overturned
and honors annulled, but children and friends
and his own household overwhelmed with calamities
and paying the penalty for crimes that he has himself
committed,—there is no one who would again be
unjust, or who would yield to his unbridled passion,
for the honors of Zeus. I have also a story to tell
that I recently heard, but I hesitate to do so lest you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>think it a fable, I will therefore keep to what is probable.
“By no means,” said Olympichus, “but
repeat it entire.” When the others also joined in
the request, I said, “Permit me to repeat what is probable
in the story and afterward, if you like, we will
take up the fable, granting, of course, that it is a
fable.”</p>

<p class='c007'>19. Now Bion says for a god to punish the children
of bad men would be more ridiculous than if a physician
were to administer medicine to the son or
grandson, for the disease of the grandfather, or the
father. In one respect the conditions are unlike, in
another they are alike, or similar. Administering
medicine to one man for the disease of another does
not, it is true, cure the patient, and a person who is
suffering from a disease of the eyes, or a fever, does
not get better when he sees another annointed or having
a plaster put on him; but the punishments of the
wicked make it evident to all men that it is the purpose
of wisely-directed justice to restrain some by
the correction of others. In what respect the comparison
made by Bion is pertinent to the inquiry, he
himself failed to notice; for suppose, now, a man falls
sick of a painful but by no means incurable disease,
then gives himself up to intemperance and effeminate
habits, and dies; and suppose, again, that his son does
not have the same disease but only a predisposition
to it,—would not a physician, or a trainer, or even a
careful master, on learning this fact, put him on a
frugal diet, and keep him from dainties and pastry,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>from drink and women, and by enjoining the continuous
use of remedies and the exercise of the body
in gymnastics, scatter and eradicate the little germ
of a big disorder, before it had reached the serious
stage? Forsooth, do not we admonish those who
are born of diseased fathers or mothers, to take heed
to themselves, and to be on their guard against
neglecting themselves, and forthwith to expel the
inbred evil while its germ is yet undeveloped, and
thus take the danger by the forelock? “Most
assuredly,” said they. “Then,” replied I, “we are
not doing an absurd but a necessary thing; not
something ridiculous but something useful, when we
recommend to the children of epileptics and hypochondriacs
and gouty persons, physical exercise and
wholesome diet and medicaments, not because they
are sick, but to the end that they may not become
sick. The body that is born of an unsound body
does not need chastisement but medical treatment
and good regimen. If anybody calls the interdiction
of pleasures and the imposition of toil and labor,
punishment, he does so because he is inept and
effeminate, and no attention need be paid to him.
Shall we say, then, that a body born of an unsound
body is worthy of care and attention, but the congenital
seeds of vice that germinate and spring up
in the young character, we are to let alone and wait
and dally, until the evil passions break forth openly,—‘show
forth the malignant fruit of the heart,’ as
Pindar says?</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>20. Of a truth, in this matter is the Deity any wiser
than Hesiod when he exhorts and advises us ‘Not
when returned from the sorrowful burial, to propagate
the race, but after the feast of the immortals?’ on the
ground that not only vice and virtue, but sorrow and
joy and all qualities, are transferred to the offspring
in procreation; that at such a time men should be
jocund and in good spirits and merry. But it does
not follow, according to Hesiod, nor is it the work of
human wisdom, but of God, to see through and
understand similarities and differences of human nature,
before they have led to great crimes and are thus
made plain to all men. For while the cubs of bears
and the whelps of wolves and monkeys immediately
disclose their inborn nature because there is nothing
to conceal or disguise it, the natural disposition of
man conforms to customs and opinions and laws, and
thus frequently puts a mask on what is evil and imitates
the good. In this way it altogether expunges
or eradicates the inborn taint of vice, or hides it for
a long time by cunningly disguising itself under the
cloak of virtue; inasmuch as we hardly take note of
any particular act of villainy, unless it falls upon us
or strikes us; or, rather, we are for the most part
accustomed to regard men as bad only when they do
a bad deed, licentious when they indulge their lusts,
and cowards when they run away. This is doing as
if we believed scorpions had a sting only when they
strike, and serpents were poisonous only when they
bite,—a foolish notion, verily! The man who proves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>to be a villain does not become so just at the moment
he is found out, but he had in him from his birth
the germs of iniquity, the thief merely seizing the
opportunity or using his power to steal, and the tyrant
to override the law. But God, depend upon it,
is not ignorant of the inclinations and nature of any
man because He looks to the soul rather than the
body; He does not wait to punish deeds of violence,
until they are done with the hands, or impurity until
it is uttered with the tongue, or lasciviousness until
it is committed with the sexual organs. He does not
take vengeance on the evil-doer from any wrong he
has himself suffered, neither is He incensed at the
robber, because he has been roughly handled, nor
does He hate the adulterer because of the disgrace;
yet, for the sake of betterment, He often punishes
the adulterer and the miser and the unjust man,
thus cutting off vice, as if it were an epilepsy, before
it becomes firmly rooted.</p>

<p class='c007'>21. A little while ago we expressed our ill-will at
the late and tardy punishment of the wicked; now we
find fault because in some cases, even before they
perpetrate any evil deed, God checks the natural
bent and disposition of men, though we are aware
that the future is often worse and more to be feared
than the past, and what is dormant than what is
apparent. We are not able to fathom the reasons
why it is sometimes better to let men commit crimes
and sometimes better to anticipate them while they
are merely deliberating and contriving; just as some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>medicines are not adapted to certain patients, though
helpful to others who are not actually sick, and yet
in a worse condition than the former. For this
reason the gods do not ‘turn all the transgressions of
the parents upon their offspring,’ but if a virtuous son
is begotten by a wicked father, as it were, a sound
man, by one who is diseased, he averts the penalty
from the house, the offspring of one being, so to
speak, adopted into another. But it is fitting that a
young man who conforms himself to the likeness of
a corrupt family should also share the chastisement
of its villainies as a debt incurred by inheritance.
Antigonus was not punished on account of Demetrius,
any more than the heroes of the olden time,
Phyleus and Nestor, for the sake of Augeas and Neleus;
since these men, though sprung from wicked fathers,
were themselves good men. But those who cherish
and take naturally to the baseness that is born in
them must also expect to be pursued to the end by
that justice which the likeness of vice demands. For
just as warts and livid spots and freckles that fathers
sometimes have, are not on their sons, but afterwards
reappear on the grandsons, and granddaughters; and
a certain Greek woman who had given birth to a
black child for which she was charged with adultery
until she proved that she was descended from an
Ethiopian in the fourth generation; and one of the
sons of Pytho of Nisibis, who recently died, and who
was said to be sprung from the Sparti, was born with
the print of a spear on his body—in which case the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>family likeness reappeared and came to the surface
as out of the deep, after such a long space of time,—so
in like manner the character and passions of the
soul are often concealed in the first generations and
remain unknown, but some time afterward and in
other persons nature springs up and asserts its
power, either for virtue or vice.”</p>

<p class='c007'>22. When he had spoken thus he held his peace,
whereupon Olympichus said with a smile, “We do
not give you our approval lest we shall seem to excuse
you from telling the story, on the ground that the
case has been sufficiently proved; but we shall only
then render our verdict when we have heard that.”
In this wise I accordingly began: “Thespesius of Soli,
a kinsman and friend of the Protagenes who spent
some time here with us, having passed the first part
of his life in great dissoluteness, and having speedily
squandered all his patrimony, now pressed by the
exigencies of his situation, for some time led a vicious
life; besides repenting of his bad management, he
also sought in every way to recover what he had lost,
and acted just like those libertines who care nothing
for their wives so long as they are in possession of
them, but after they are divorced and married to
other men, basely try to corrupt them. Accordingly,
by holding aloof from no act of meanness that brought
either gratification or gain, he acquired in a short
time not only very great possessions, but also the
reputation of being a thorough scoundrel. Above all,
an oracle brought from Amphilochus gave him a bad
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>name; for having asked the god through a messenger,
as we are told, whether he would lead a better
life in the future, the answer came back that it would
be better with him after he was dead. And in a
measure this turned out to be true, not long after.
For happening to fall on his head from a height he
lay like one dead from the shock alone, for he had
received no wound, and on the third day was already
carried forth for burial. Then all at once recovering
strength and coming to himself, he showed a most
astonishing change in his manner of life; for the
Cilicians know of no man of his time more just in
dealings between man and man, none more reverent
toward the gods, none more dreaded by his enemies,
or more faithful to his friends. Consequently all
who knew him were eager to hear the cause of this
transformation, as they thought such an alteration of
character could not be a mere matter of chance—which
was in fact the case, as he himself related to
Protagenes and other equally intimate friends. For
when he lost consciousness,—(literally, when his
rational soul left his body)—he at first experienced
about the same sensation as the result of the change
that a pilot would feel who should be hurled from a
ship into the deep; afterwards, having recovered a
little, he thought he had entirely regained his breath
and was able to see on every side with his soul
opened as if it were all one eye. Yet he beheld none
of the former things, but the objects he recognized
were stars of immense magnitude at immeasurable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>distances from one another, and a radiance proceeding
from them, surprising in its brilliancy and color,
in which his soul moved about with facility just as a
man in a calm moves a ship in any direction, easily
and quickly. Though he omitted most of what he
saw, he said that the souls of the dead, rising from
below, made flame-like bubbles as they displaced the
air before them; then, as each bubble noiselessly burst,
the souls came forth, human in form but of a smaller
size. Their movements, however, were not alike,
for some started forth with surprising fleetness and
darted straight up, while others whirled round in a
circle just like spindles, and whisking, now upward,
now downward, with a kind of confused and aimless
motion, they came to rest only after a long time and
with great difficulty. Respecting most of the souls,
however, he was in ignorance as to who they were; but
recognizing two or three of his acquaintances, he tried
to approach and address them, yet they neither heard
him nor were in their right mind, but beside themselves
and dazed, trying to avoid all notice and intercourse,
moving aimlessly about, at first alone by
themselves, then encountering many who were in a
like condition, they joined themselves to these, and,
tossed about in a disorderly manner in all directions,
they uttered unintelligible cries that sounded like
mingled screams of lamentation and fear. Others,
again, were seen at the very summit of the upper air,
radiant with joy, frequently approaching each other
with signs of affection, but avoiding the disorderly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>ones and testifying their aversion, as he thought, by
drawing themselves together, but their delight and
satisfaction, by expanding and extending themselves.
Here, he said, he recognized the soul of one of his
kinsmen, though not quite distinctly, for he had died
when yet very young; but drawing near it saluted
him with, ‘Hail, Thespesius!’ When he, in surprise,
rejoined that his name was not Thespesius, but
Aridaeus. ‘Formerly, it is true,’ replied the spirit,
‘that was thy name, but henceforth it is Thespesius
(the Divine). For thou didst not die, but through
the interposition of God art come hither in the full
possession of thy faculties; the other part of thy soul
thou hast left behind in thy body, as it were an
anchor; and let this be a token to thee both, now,
and henceforth, that the souls of the departed neither
cast a shadow nor move the eyelids.’ On hearing
this, Thespesius, who had by this time somewhat
recovered consciousness, looked and beheld a kind of
faint line about himself, while the rest were completely
encircled with a radiance and diaphanous,
though not all in the same manner, for some, like the
moon in her brightest splendor, had a uniformly
smooth and even color, while others were marked
with a kind of spots or faint weals; others again
were all variegated and strange to look upon; while
still others were marked with livid fleckings like
vipers, and some even showed slight scarifications.
The kinsman of Thespesius explained these things in
detail (for there is nothing to hinder us from calling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>the souls of men by the name they themselves bore
during life) by reciting that Adrastea, the daughter
of Necessity and Zeus, had been placed in the highest
seat as the avenger of all crimes, and that there is no
wicked man so powerful or so insignificant as to be
able, either by craft or by force, to escape her. Three
attendants wait upon her to each of whom has been
assigned a different mode of inflicting punishment:
those who are to be chastised while yet in the body
and by means of the body, swift Poena (Punishment)
seizes, though in a rather mild way that still leaves
behind many things needing expiation; those whose
cure is a matter of greater difficulty on account of
their vices, the daemon hands over, after death, to
Dike (Justice), while those that Dike gives up as
entirely incorrigible, the third and most terrible of
the attendants of Adrastea, Erinys (the Fury), pursues,
and after hounding them as they rush about
trying to escape her in one way or another, she puts
them all out of sight in a pitiless and awful way by
thrusting them into a nameless and invisible abyss.
Of the other punishments, said he, that inflicted by
Poena in this life is like those of the non-Greeks.
For as among the Persians the clothes and tiaras of
those who are undergoing chastisement are pulled
off and they are scourged, while the culprits beg
with tears that their castigation may be ended; so
the punishments suffered in body or estate are no
severe affliction, nor do they touch vice itself, but
are chiefly for appearance sake and for the outward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>sense. But him who comes hither from there, unpunished
and unpurged, Dike seizes and exposes his
soul in all its nakedness, and there is no place where
it can hide or go into concealment or cover up its
baseness, but it is completely seen on all sides and
by everybody. At first Dike shows this soul to
honest parents, if such he had, or to ancestors, as a
detestable creature and unworthy (of such ancestry);
but if they were likewise wicked, he sees them undergoing
chastisement, while he is in turn beheld by
them receiving his deserts and expiating, for a long
time, each of his evil passions with pains and torments
which as far exceed in sharpness those endured
in the flesh as the reality exceeds in distinctness
the mere vision (before you). The stripes and
weals for each of the passions remain on some a
longer, on others a shorter time.” ‘Observe also,’
said he, ‘the variegated and party-colored appearance
of the souls; the darkish and filthy hue is the
mark of fraud and avarice, while the blood-red and
flame-colored indicates cruelty and ugliness of temper;
where the soul has a bluish color, a lack of self-control
as against lust has not been wholly eradicated
from it; inherent malevolence combined with
envy give out the violet color and festering appearance
underneath, just as the cuttle-fish sets free its
black fluid. For yonder (in the world), vice, when
the soul is changed by its passions and changes the
body, occasions a variety of colors, but here (in the
realm of departed spirits) there is an end of purification
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>and punishment, and when the passions are
purged out, the soul recovers entirely its native luster
and uniform color. Until this takes place, paroxysms
of passion break forth, causing relapses and heart-throbs,
in some cases faint and easily recovered from,
in others exceedingly violent. Some of the souls,
after undergoing repeated castigations resume their
natural character and disposition; others again are
carried away into the bodies of animals by the force
and power of ignorance and the innate love of sensual
gratification; for, owing to the weakness of the
reasoning faculty and a disinclination to discursive
thought, one is impelled by its active principle to
procreation, while another, though lacking an instrument
of sensual gratification, yet longs to satisfy its
desires with worldly pleasures and to attain its ends
by means of the body, for in this place there is only
a kind of imperfect shadow and vision of joys that
can have no reality.’ When the spirit had thus
spoken, it conducted him (Thespesius) swiftly through
boundless space, as he thought, easily and without
deviation, borne up by the beams of light as if on
wings, until he came to a wide and deep chasm where
the power that supported him gave way; he saw, too,
that the other souls had a like experience at that
place, for these, crowding together like birds, and
darting downward, flew about the chasm,—for they
dared not venture to pass directly across it—which
he saw was decorated within like the grottoes of
Bacchus, with shrubbery and plants and with all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>sorts of green twigs bearing flowers; it also sent forth
a gentle and agreeable breeze which was singularly
pleasant and which produced the same effect that
wine does on those who are addicted to it, for the
souls that inhaled these fragrant odors were in
ecstasies of joy and embraced one another. All
around this place there was revelry and laughter, together
with every kind of enjoyment and merry-making.
He said that here Dionysus had ascended
and had afterwards fetched up Semele and that it was
called the place of Forgetfulness (Lethe). Here, too,
Thespesius desired to tarry, but his conductor would
not allow it, and hurried him forcibly away, at the
same time telling him that the rational soul is melted
and dissolved under the influence of pleasure, but
that the irrational and carnal part, moistened and
clothed in flesh, revives the memory of the body, and
as a result of this reminiscense, a desire and a concupiscence
that incites to procreation; for which
reason it is called an <i>inclination toward the earth</i>
because the soul is weighed down with moisture.
Passing next over another way of equal extent, he
thought he saw a huge goblet into which streams
flowed, of which one was of a whiter color than the
foam of the sea or snow; another, purple like the
iris; while others again showed, from afar, different
hues, each of which shone with its own particular
luster, yet when he came near, the ambient air became
more and more rarified, the colors became
fainter, and the goblet lost its brilliant tints, except
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>the white. Here he saw three supernatural beings
(daemons) sitting by one another in the form of a
triangle, mixing together the streams with certain
measures. The conductor of the soul of Thespesius
said that to this point Orpheus had advanced when
he was following after the soul of his wife, but because
his memory partly failed him he brought back
to men an incorrect account when he said that the
oracle at Delphi was the common property of Apollo
and Night, when in sooth, there is nothing in common
between Apollo and Night. ‘But this oracle,’
the spirit said, ‘is common to night and the moon; it
gives response nowhere upon the earth and has no
fixed abode, but roams about everywhere among men,
in dreams and apparitions; and emanating from it, as
thou seest, dreams mixed up with the plain and simple
truth, spread abroad trickery and fraud. But that of
Apollo thou didst not see,’ it said, ‘nor wilt thou be
able to see it, for the earthly part of the soul neither
strives toward what is higher nor does it release (the
spiritual part), but it tends downward as long as it is
joined to the body.’ At the same time the spirit
leading him (Thespesius) nearer tried to show him
the light issuing from the tripod which, as he said,
passed through the bosom of Themis and reached as
far as Parnassus. Though greatly desiring to see it,
he was not able to do so because of its brilliancy;
but as he passed by he heard the shrill voice of a
woman chanting in verse some other things, and the
time of his death, as he thought. The supernatural
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>being (daemon) said it was the Sibyl, and that she
foretold future events as she was whirled about on
the face of the moon. Though wishing to hear more,
he was carried round to the opposite side by the
rotary motion of the moon and caught but a few
words; among which was the prediction about Mount
Vesuvius and the impending destruction of Dicaearchea
by fire, and a verse about the reigning emperor,
thus:</p>

<p class='c007'>‘Though he is good, disease shall end his reign.’
Next in order they turned to look upon those who
were undergoing punishments. From the very first
they beheld nothing but repulsive and pitiable
sights; then Thespesius quite unexpectedly came
upon kindred and acquaintances and former companions
who were in terrible sufferings and undergoing
horrible torments and pains, and who besought
him with loud lamentations to have pity on them.
Finally, he recognized his own father coming up from
a kind of abyss, all covered with marks and wounds,
stretching out his hands to him; nor did those who
directed his castigations suffer him to hold his peace,
but they compelled him to confess that he had been
guilty of a base crime against some guests, for their
gold, by taking them off with poison, and that,
though the deed was unknown to everybody in the
world above, it was known to those below. (He
also said) that he had already undergone some
torments, but was being dragged away to suffer
others. Smitten with fear and horror he durst not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>offer supplications and intercessions for his father;
but wanting to turn about and flee, he no longer
saw his kind and familiar guide, and felt himself
urged forward by other beings horrible to look upon,
by whom he was compelled to pass among and behold
the chastisements of others of his acquaintances
who had openly led a wicked life, though the
shade of those who had been punished in the world
was less grievously tormented than the rest, and not
in the same way, as they were merely condemned to
severe toil for the irrational nature and the passions.
On the other hand, those who had worn the
garb and assumed the name of virtue, but had in
secret led corrupt lives, were forced by other tormentors,
with severe exertion and great pain, to turn
the inner parts of the soul outward; which action
being so contrary to their nature, they performed it
with wrigglings and contortions like those made by
the marine scolopendra when they have swallowed
the hook; some, their tormentors flayed and laid
open in order to show how corrupt and flecked they
were, and that their iniquity had its root in the
reason which is the noblest part of the soul. Other
souls, he also said, he observed coiled about each other
by twos and threes and even more, gnawing one another
on the score of old grudges for the deeds of
malice they had suffered or committed in life. And
he noticed further, some lakes alongside of each
other, one of which was of seething gold, another
of exceeding cold lead, and still another of hard iron;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>that over these stood certain demons who in turn,
like smiths, seized with tongs the souls of those who
had been guilty of insatiable greed and avarice,
drawing them out and thrusting them in. When
they had become heated through and diaphanous in
the gold from the effects of the burning, they were
plunged into the sea of lead; having become congealed
here and hard as hailstones, they were next
thrust into the lake of iron, where they turned completely
black, and were then twisted round and
round because of their hard-heartedness, and rubbed
together until they lost all semblance of their former
selves. They were then put once more into
the lake of gold to undergo, as he said, awful torments
by the change. But he said those endured
the keenest anguish, who, supposing they had been
released by Justice (Dike) were seized anew: these
were the souls of those for whose transgressions
their descendants or children had to pay the penalty.
For whenever one of these arrived and encountered
the other, he fell upon the shade in great wrath,
uttering loud cries and showing the marks of what
he had endured, at the same time execrating and
pursuing it while it endeavored to flee away and hide
itself, yet could not. For swiftly did the avengers of
justice pursue such, dragging them back again amid
loud lamentations because they foreknew their impending
doom. To some of the souls, he said, many
of their descendants at the same time attached themselves
like bees or bats, uttering shrill cries and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>falling into transports of rage at the recollection of
what they had endured for their sakes; and last of
all he saw the souls of those who were undergoing
the preparation for a second birth by a forced transformation
into all sorts of animals, and by metempsychosis
at the hands of those who were appointed
to the task. These, by the use of certain tools, and
with blows, hammered together entire members,
turned others round, scraped down or removed others
entirely in order to adapt them to different modes of
life, among which also appeared the soul of Nero
that had already undergone the other castigations,
and had been transfixed with red-hot nails. When the
workmen had begun to prepare the figure of a Pindaric
viper, in which it was destined to live after it
had been conceived and had eaten its way out of its
mother, he said that a great light appeared and a
voice came out of the light commanding that it be
transformed into some more gentle creature and
made over into an animal that is wont to chant
around marshes and ponds, as he had already expiated
his crimes, and some consideration was due
him at the hands of the gods for freeing Greece, the
land in which dwelt the best and most god-favored of
his subjects. Thus far now Thespesius was an eyewitness;
but when he was about to turn back, he got
into the utmost perplexity through fright; for a
woman, imposing by her stature and beauty, taking
hold of him, said, ‘Pray come hither, my friend, in
order that you may the better remember everything’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>(you have seen). And as she was about to apply to
him a little red-hot iron rod such as the painters
in encaustic are wont to use, another woman interfered.
But he himself was carried away all at once
by a sudden and very violent gust of wind, as if
blown through a tube, and so lighting again in his
own body, he was restored to life, as it were, on the
very brink of the grave.”</p>

writers, whose monotheism is beyond question, frequently use
the article before the name of God. In like manner proper

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>The purport of the passage is plain, but the parallelism
between the fact and the figure is not very close. The idea is
much older than Plutarch.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='sc'>Chap. 4.</span> “The ingle-side” or ancestral hearth. According
to the ancients the hearth was the center and beginning of
the family and the state. The expression, which is often
used by Plato and others, is equivalent to the <i>remotest beginning</i>.
Compare also the Roman Vesta.</p>

<p class='c003'>5. “God having placed Himself,” etc. The following extract
from the Timaeus of Plato will serve to illustrate our
author’s meaning. “Let me tell you then why the Creator
made this world of generation. He was good, and the good
can never have any jealousy of anything. And being free
from jealousy, he desired that all things should be as like
himself as they could be. This is in the truest sense the
origin of creation and of the world, as we shall do well in believing
on the testimony of wise men. God desired that all
things should be good and nothing bad, so far as this was
attainable. Wherefore also finding the whole visible sphere
not at rest, but moving in an irregular and disorderly fashion,
out of disorder he brought order, considering that this was in
every way better than the other. Now the deeds of the best
could never be or have been other than the fairest and best;
and the Creator, reflecting on the things which are by nature
visible, found that no unintelligent creature taken as a whole
was fairer than the intelligent taken as a whole; and that intelligence
could not be present in anything which was devoid
of soul. For which reason, when he was framing the universe,
he put intelligence in soul, and soul in body, that he
might be the creator of a work which was, by nature, fairest.
Wherefore, using the language of probability, we may say that
the world became a living creature, truly endowed with soul
and intelligence by the providence of God.”</p>

<p class='c003'>6. “Souls going forth from him.” The idea here is, that
the human soul existed previous to its incarnation in the human
body, and that it is a direct emanation from the Deity.
This doctrine is fully expounded by Plato. How to establish
the immortality of the soul, if it comes into existence with the
body, was a serious problem with the ancients. Plutarch
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>seems to have regarded both the soul and the body as eternal
and uncreated, but the latter without form until it was united
with the soul. Or we may put the case otherwise by saying
that the soul, upon entering into a conscious existence, shapes
the hitherto formless body into an abode for itself. He also
holds that the soul consists of two parts: The one part seeks
after truth and has an affection for the beautiful; the other is
subject to the passions and under the dominion of error.
“For which reason,” the author here assumes that the words
ἔθος and ἦθος are from the same root. The former means, use
and wont; the latter was originally applied to the haunts or
abodes of animals; then the manners, habits, and dispositions
of men. Aristotle says, ἡ δ᾽ ἠθικὴ ἐξ ἔθους περιγίνεται, ὅθεν καὶ
τοῦνομα ἔσχηκε μικρὸν περικλῖνον ἀπὸ τοῦ ἤθους. (Ethical is
from ἔθος, for which reason the word differs but slightly from
ἤθος.) Plutarch himself says that custom is second nature.
It is easy to trace the connection between a man’s acts and the
psychical forces, the character, that produces them.</p>

<p class='c003'>8. “An ill-omened deed.” It was a prevalent belief in
antiquity that misfortunes fell upon those who were concerned
in disturbing a swallow’s nest.</p>

<p class='c003'>10. Near the end. The Greeks ventured to consult oracles
of the dead only on rare and extraordinary occasions. They
probably borrowed the custom from the East.</p>

<p class='c003'>11. The story of Glaucus is told at length by Herodotus in
the third book of his history and is often alluded to by later
writers. The ethical import of the anecdote is far-reaching.</p>

<p class='c003'>17. “Gardens of Adonis.” Shakespeare probably had these
in mind when he wrote (King Henry VI. Part 1, scene sixth):
“Thy promises are like Adonis’ gardens, That one day bloomed
and fruitful were the next.” At Taenarus, the most southern
point of the Peloponnesus, there was believed to be an entrance
to the lower world.</p>

<p class='c003'>22. “None more dreaded by his enemies.” To return good
for good and evil for evil was a fundamental article of Greek
ethics. It is more than once alluded to in the Anabasis, and is
found in nearly all Greek writers. Socrates, however, takes a
firm stand against the principle and maintains that whatever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>is intrinsically wrong can never under any circumstances become
right.</p>

<p class='c003'>“An inclination toward the earth.” The author here assumes
that γένεσις, procreation, beginning, is both in fact and
etymologically, connected with νεῦσις ἐπὶ γῆν, an inclination
or tendency toward the earth. It need hardly be said that his
idea is pure fancy.</p>

<p class='c003'>This eruption of Vesuvius, as is well known, took place in
the year 79. Decaearchea or Puteoli was one of the cities
destroyed together with Herculaneum, Pompei and others.
Vespasian was one of the few Roman emperors, who, up to his
time, died a natural death.</p>

<p class='c003'>What is meant by a Pindaric viper is not known. Plutarch
is evidently of the opinion that its young gnaw their way out
of the mother’s womb instead of being born in the natural
way, and the allusion to Nero’s treatment of his mother is
plain. Nero’s love for music and his proficiency in the musical
art are evidently held up to ridicule in this passage.</p>

with an index of names. As these treatises are usually
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>cited by their Latin titles, they only are given above. A complete
edition of Plutarch’s Morals, with an introduction by R. W.
Emerson was published in Boston about twenty-five years ago,
under the editorial supervision of Professor Goodwin of Harvard
University. The translations were made by a number of
English scholars near the close of the seventeenth century. In
their revised form they are in the main correct and some of them
are vigorous and readable.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r1'>1</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It is a noteworthy fact that many of Rome’s great men were
Spaniards, while many others were not natives of the city.
Among the former were the emperors Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus
and Marcus Aurelius. The two Senecas, Lucan, Martial
and Quintillian were also Spaniards. Vespasian was born
at Reate; Livy, in Padua; Horace, at Venusia; Virgil, in Mantua;
Cicero, at Arpinum; the emperor Claudius, at Lugdunum;
the two Plinys, at Comum, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r2'>2</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Seneca is generally regarded as the first Roman writer who
used <i>caro</i>, flesh, as distinct from, and opposed to, spirit.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f3'>
<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r3'>3</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Students of German literature are reminded of a certain
moral and intellectual similarity between Plutarch and Gellert.
The latter, though a man of much less natural ability, had all of
Plutarch’s kindliness, moral and religious earnestness, sympathy
for those in distress, and the same popularity among all classes
from prince to peasant. Both were equally religious, though one
was a heathen and the other a Christian; both preserved the
same serenity of mind and cheerfulness of heart in a time of
national degradation and immorality.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f4'>
<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r4'>4</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“When Plutarch, after the death of his daughter; was writing
a letter of consolation to his wife, we find him turning away
from all the commonplaces of the stoics as the recollection of
one simple trait of his little child rushed upon his mind:—‘She
desired her nurse to press even her dolls to her breast. She was
so loving that she wished everything that gave her pleasure to
share in the best she had.’” The statement that Seneca is all
man will be questioned by those who know that two of his Letters
of Condolence are addressed to women. These are almost
the only writings in Roman literature so addressed.</p>
